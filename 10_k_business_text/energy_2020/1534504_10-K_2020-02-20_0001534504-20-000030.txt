On April 24, 2019, PBFX entered into a contribution agreement with PBF LLC (the TVPC Contribution Agreement ), pursuant to which PBF LLC contributed to PBFX all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of TVP Holding Company LLC ( TVP Holding ) for total consideration of $200.0 million (the TVPC Acquisition ). Prior to the TVPC Acquisition, TVP Holding owned a 50% membership interest in the Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC ( TVPC ). Subsequent to the closing of the TVPC Acquisition on May 31, 2019, PBFX owns 100% of the membership interests in TVPC. The transaction was financed through a combination of proceeds from the 2019 Registered Direct Offering (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ) and borrowings under the PBFX five year, $500.0 million amended and restated revolving credit facility (the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility ). See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 10 Recent Developments Martinez Acquisition On February 1, 2020, we acquired from Equilon Enterprises LLC d b a Shell Oil Products US (the "Seller"), the Martinez refinery and related logistics assets (collectively, the Martinez Acquisition ), pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated June 11, 2019 (the Sale and Purchase Agreement ). The Martinez refinery is located on an 860 acre site in the City of Martinez, 30 miles northeast of San Francisco, California. The refinery is a high conversion 157,000 bpd, dual coking facility with a Nelson Complexity Index of 16.1, making it 1 of the most complex refineries in the United States. The facility is strategically positi1d in Northern California and provides for operating and commercial synergies with the Torrance refinery located in Southern California. The Martinez Acquisition further increases our total throughput capacity to over 1,000,000 bpd. In addition to refining assets, the Martinez Acquisition includes a number of high quality onsite logistics assets, including a deep water marine facility, product distribution terminals and refinery crude and product storage facilities with approximately 8.8 million barrels of shell capacity. The purchase price for the Martinez Acquisition was $960.0 million plus approximately $230.0 million for estimated hydrocarbon inventory, which is subject to final valuation. In addition, PBF Holding also has an obligation to make certain post closing payments to the Seller if certain conditions are met including earn out payments based on certain earnings thresholds of the Martinez refinery (as set forth in the Sale and Purchase Agreement), for a period of up to four years following the closing. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand, including proceeds from our offering of the 2028 Senior Notes, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (both, as defined below).

Our five oil refineries, including certain related logistics assets that are not owned by PBFX, are engaged in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, and are aggregated into the Refining segment. PBFX operates certain logistics assets such as crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines and storage facilities. Certain of PBFX assets were previously operated and owned by various subsidiaries of PBF Holding and were acquired by PBFX in a series of transactions since its inception. PBFX is reported in the Logistics segment. A substantial majority of PBFX revenues are derived from long term, fee based commercial agreements with PBF Holding and its subsidiaries and these intersegment related revenues are eliminated in consolidation. See Note 21 Segment Information of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for detailed information on our operating results by business segment. Refining Segment Subsequent to the Martinez Acquisition, we own and operate six refineries providing geographic and market diversity. We produce a variety of products at each of our refineries, including gasoline, ULSD, heating oil, jet fuel, lubricants, petrochemicals and asphalt. We sell our products throughout the Northeast, Midwest, Gulf Coast and West Coast of the United States, as well as in other regions of the United States, Canada and Mexico, and are able to ship products to other international destinations. Our refinery assets as of December 31, 2019 are described below. Delaware City Refinery Overview. The Delaware City refinery is located on an approximately 5,000 acre site, with access to waterborne cargoes and an extensive distribution ne2rk of pipelines, barges and tankers, truck and rail. Delaware City is a fully integrated operation that receives crude via rail at its crude unloading facilities, or ship or barge at its docks located on the Delaware River. The crude and other feedstocks are stored in an extensive tank farm prior to processing. In addition, there is a 15 lane, 76,000 bpd capacity truck loading rack (the Truck Rack ) located adjacent to the refinery and a 23 mile interstate pipeline (the DCR Products Pipeline ) that are used to distribute clean products. The DCR Products Pipeline and Truck Rack were sold to PBFX in May 2015. As a result of its configuration and process units, Delaware City has the capability of processing a slate of heavy crudes with a high concentration of high sulfur crudes, as well as other high sulfur feedstock when economically viable, and is 1 of the largest and most complex refineries on the East Coast. The Delaware City refinery is 1 of 2 heavy crude coking refineries, the other being our Paulsboro refinery, on the East Coast of the United States with coking capacity equal to approximately 25% of crude capacity. The Delaware City refinery primarily processes a variety of medium to heavy, sour crude oils, but can run light, sweet crude oils as well. The refinery has large conversion capacity with its 82,000 bpd fluid catalytic cracking unit ( FCC unit ), 52,000 bpd fluid coking unit and 21,000 bpd hydrocracking unit. 13 The following table approximates the Delaware City refinery major process unit capacities.

The Delaware City refinery predominantly produces gasoline, jet fuel, ULSD and ultra low sulfur heating oil as well as certain other products. Products produced at the Delaware City refinery are transferred to customers through pipelines, barges or at its truck rack. We market and sell all of our refined products independently to a variety of customers on the spot market or through term agreements. Inventory Intermediation Agreement. On August 29, 2019, we entered into amended and restated inventory intermediation agreements with J. Aron, (as amended from time to time, the Inventory Intermediation Agreements ), to support the operations of the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries (the East Coast Refineries ). The Inventory Intermediation Agreement by and among J. Aron, PBF Holding and DCR expires on June 30, 2021, which term may be further extended by mutual consent of the parties to June 30, 2022 Pursuant to each Inventory Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron purchases and holds title to certain inventory, including crude oil, intermediate and certain finished products (the J. Aron Products ), produced by the East Coast Refineries and delivered into the Company storage tanks at the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries and at PBFX East Coast Storage Assets (collectively the J. Aron Storage Tanks ). Furthermore, J. Aron agrees to sell the J. Aron Products back to the East Coast Refineries as the J. Aron Products are discharged out of our J. Aron Storage Tanks. At expiration, we will have to repurchase the inventories outstanding under the Inventory Intermediation Agreement at that time. Tankage Capacity. The Delaware City refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 10.0 million barrels. Of the total, approximately 36 million barrels of storage capacity are dedicated to crude oil and other feedstock storage with the remaining 6.4 million barrels allocated to finished products, intermediates and other products. Energy and Other Utilities. Under normal operating conditions, the Delaware City refinery consumes approximately 75,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Delaware City refinery has a 280 MW power plant located on site that consists of 2 natural gas fueled turbines with combined capacity of approximately 140 MW and four turbo generators with combined nameplate capacity of approximately 140 MW. Collectively, this power plant produces electricity in excess of Delaware City refinery load of approximately 90 MW. Excess electricity is sold into the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland, or PJM, grid. Steam is primarily produced by a combination of 3 dedicated boilers, 2 heat recovery steam generators on the gas 14 turbines, and is supplemented by secondary boilers at the FCC and Coker. Hydrogen is currently provided via the refinery steam methane reformer and continuous catalytic reformer. Hydrogen Plant Project. During 2018, we signed an agreement with a third party for an additional supply of 25 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen from a new hydrogen generation facility constructed on site (the Hydrogen Facility ), which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. Upon completion of the Hydrogen Facility, this additional hydrogen will provide additional complex crude and feedstock processing capabilities. Paulsboro Refinery Overview. The Paulsboro refinery is located on approximately 950 acres on the Delaware River in Paulsboro, New Jersey, near Philadelphia and approximately 30 miles away from Delaware City. Paulsboro receives crude and feedstocks via its marine terminal on the Delaware River. Paulsboro is 1 of 2 operating refineries on the East Coast with coking capacity, the other being our Delaware City refinery. The Paulsboro refinery primarily processes a variety of medium and heavy, sour crude oils but can run light, sweet crude oils as well. The following table approximates the Paulsboro refinery major process unit capacities. Unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day.

The crude purchased under this contract is priced off the ASCI. Refined Product Yield and Distribution. The Paulsboro refinery predominantly produces gasoline, diesel fuels and jet fuel and also manufactures Group I base oils or lubricants and asphalt. Products produced at the Paulsboro refinery are transferred to customers primarily through pipelines or at its truck rack. We market and sell all of our refined products independently to a variety of customers on the spot market or through term agreements under which we sell approximately 35% of our Paulsboro refinery gasoline production. Inventory Intermediation Agreement. As discussed above under Delaware City Refinery Inventory Intermediation Agreement , we currently have Inventory Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron to support the operations of the East Coast Refineries and facilitate the purchase and sale of certain crude and refined products amongst the parties. The Inventory Intermediation Agreement by and among J. Aron, PBF Holding and PRC expires on December 31, 2021, which term may be further extended by mutual consent of the parties to December 31, 2022 At expiration, we will be required to repurchase the inventories outstanding under the Inventory Intermediation Agreement at that time. Tankage Capacity. The Paulsboro refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 7.5 million barrels. Of the total, approximately 21 million barrels are dedicated to crude oil storage with the remaining 5.4 million barrels allocated to finished products, intermediates and other products. 15 Energy and Other Utilities. Under normal operating conditions, the Paulsboro refinery consumes approximately 40,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Paulsboro refinery is mostly self sufficient for electrical power through a mix of gas and steam turbine generators. The Paulsboro refinery generation typically supplies about 57 MW of the total 63 MW total refinery load. There are circumstances where available generation is greater than the total refinery load, but the Paulsboro refinery does not typically export power to the utility grid. If necessary, supplemental electrical power is available on a guaranteed basis from the local utility. The Paulsboro refinery is connected to the grid via 3 separate 69KV aerial feeders and has the ability to run entirely on imported power. Steam is produced in 3 boilers and a heat recovery steam generator fed by the exhaust from the gas turbine. In addition, there are a number of waste heat boilers and furnace stack economizers throughout the refinery that supplement the steam generation capacity. The Paulsboro refinery current hydrogen needs are primarily met by the hydrogen supply from the reformer. In addition, the refinery has available a standal1 steam methane reformer. This ancillary hydrogen plant is utilized as a back up source of hydrogen for the refinery process units. Toledo Refinery Overview . The Toledo refinery primarily processes a slate of light, sweet crudes from Canada, the Mid Continent, the Bakken region and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Toledo refinery is located on a 282 acre site near Toledo, Ohio, approximately 60 miles from Detroit. Crude is delivered to the Toledo refinery through 3 primary pipelines (1) Enbridge from the north, (2) Patoka from the west and (3) Mid Valley from the south. Crude is also delivered to a nearby terminal by rail and from local sources by truck to a truck unloading facility within the refinery.

We source our crude oil needs for Toledo primarily through short term and spot market agreements. Refined Product Yield and Distribution. Toledo produces finished products, including gasoline, jet and ULSD, in addition to a variety of high value petrochemicals including benzene, toluene, xylene, n1ne and tetramer. Toledo is connected, via pipelines, to an extensive distribution ne2rk throughout Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The finished products are transported on pipelines owned by Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and Buckeye Partners. In addition, we have proprietary connections to a variety of smaller pipelines and spurs that help us optimize our clean products distribution. A significant portion of Toledo gasoline and ULSD are distributed through various terminals in this ne2rk. We have an agreement with Sunoco whereby Sunoco purchases gasoline and distillate products representing approximately 1 third of the Toledo refinery gasoline and distillates production. The agreement had an initial 3 year term, subject to certain early termination rights. In March 2019, the agreement was renewed and extended for a 3 year term. We sell the bulk of the petrochemicals produced at the Toledo refinery through short term contracts or on the spot market and the majority of the petrochemical distribution is d1 via rail. 16 Tankage Capacity. The Toledo refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 4.5 million barrels. The Toledo refinery receives its crude through pipeline connections and a truck rack. Of the total, approximately 13 million barrels are dedicated to crude oil storage with the remaining 32 million barrels allocated to intermediates and products. A portion of storage capacity dedicated to crude oil and finished products was sold to PBFX in conjunction with its acquisition of the Toledo Storage Facility (as defined below) in December 2014. Energy and Other Utilities. Under normal operating conditions, the Toledo refinery consumes approximately 20,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Toledo refinery purchases its electricity from the PJM grid and has a long term contract to purchase hydrogen and steam from a local third party supplier. In addition to the third party steam supplier, Toledo consumes a portion of the steam that is generated by its various process units. Chalmette Refinery Overview . The Chalmette refinery is located on a 400 acre site near New Orleans, Louisiana. It is a dual train coking refinery and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil through its 189,000 bpd crude units and downstream units. Chalmette Refining owns 100% of the MOEM Pipeline, providing access to the Empire Terminal, as well as the CAM Connection Pipeline, providing access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port facility through a third party pipeline. Chalmette Refining also owns 80% of each of the Collins Pipeline Company and T&M Terminal Company, both located in Collins, Mississippi, which provide a clean products outlet for the refinery to the Plantation and Colonial Pipelines. In addition, there is also a marine terminal capable of importing waterborne feedstocks and loading or unloading finished products; a clean products truck rack which provides access to local markets; and a crude and product storage facility. The following table approximates the Chalmette refinery major process unit capacities. Unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day. Refinery Units Nameplate Capacity Crude Distillation Units 189,000 Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit 72,000 Hydrotreating Units 186,000 Delayed Coking Unit 40,000 Catalytic Reforming Unit 40,000 Alkylation Unit 15,000 Feedstocks and Supply Arrangements. We source our crude oil and feedstock needs for Chalmette through connections to the CAM Pipeline and MOEM Pipeline as well as our marine terminal. On November 1, 2015, we entered into a market based crude supply agreement with Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. ( PDVSA ) that has a ten year term with a renewal option for an additional five years, subject to certain early termination rights. The pricing for the crude supply is market based and is agreed upon on a quarterly basis by both parties. We have not sourced crude oil under this agreement since 2017 as PDVSA has suspended deliveries due to the parties inability to agree to mutually acceptable payment terms and because of U.S. government sanctions against PDVSA. Refined Product Yield and Distribution. The Chalmette refinery predominantly produces gasoline and diesel fuels and also manufactures high value petrochemicals including benzene and xylene. Products produced at the Chalmette refinery are transferred to customers through pipelines, the marine terminal and truck rack. The majority of our clean products are delivered to customers via pipelines. Our ownership of the Collins Pipeline and T&M Terminal provides Chalmette with strategic access to Southeast and East Coast markets through third party logistics. Tankage Capacity. Chalmette has a total tankage capacity of approximately 8.1 million barrels. Of this total, approximately 26 million barrels are allocated to crude oil storage with the remaining 5.5 million barrels allocated to intermediates and products. 17 Energy and Other Utilities. Under normal operating conditions, the Chalmette refinery consumes approximately 19,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Chalmette refinery purchases its electricity from a local utility and has a long term contract to purchase hydrogen from a third party supplier. Coker Project The Chalmette refinery restarted its idled 12,000 barrel per day coker unit in the fourth quarter of 2019 to capture the potential benefit of processing additional heavy and high sulfur feedstocks. The unit has increased the refinery total coking capacity to approximately 40,000 barrels per day. Torrance Refinery Overview . The Torrance refinery is located on 750 acres in Torrance, California. It is a high conversion crude, delayed coking refinery capable of processing both heavy and medium crude oils through its crude unit and downstream units. In addition to refining assets, the Torrance refinery includes a number of high quality logistics assets including a sophisticated ne2rk of crude and products pipelines, product distribution terminals and refinery crude and product storage facilities. The most significant logistics asset is a crude gathering and transportation system which delivers San Joaquin Valley crude oils directly from the field to the refinery. Additionally, included in the refinery are several pipelines which provide access to sources of waterborne crude oils including the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, as well as clean product outlets with a direct pipeline that supplies jet fuel to the Los Angeles airport. The following table approximates the Torrance refinery major process unit capacities. Unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day.

The Torrance refinery primarily processes a variety of medium and heavy crude oils. On July 1, 2016, we entered into a crude supply agreement with Exxon Mobil Oil Corporation ( ExxonMobil ) for approximately 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at our Torrance refinery. This crude supply agreement has a five year term with an automatic renewal feature unless either party gives thirty six months written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. Additionally, we obtain crude and feedstocks from other sources through connections to third party pipelines as well as ship docks and truck racks. Refined Product Yield and Distribution. The Torrance refinery predominantly produces gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuels. Products produced at the Torrance refinery are transferred to customers through pipelines, the marine terminal and truck rack. The majority of clean products are delivered to customers via pipelines. On July 1, 2016, we entered into an offtake agreement with ExxonMobil pursuant to which ExxonMobil purchased up to 50% of our gasoline production. This offtake agreement had an initial term of 3 years and was not renewed upon expiration on July 1, 2019. We currently market and sell all of our refined products independently to a variety of customers either on the spot market or through term agreements. Tankage Capacity. Torrance has a total tankage capacity of approximately 8.6 million barrels. Of this total, approximately 21 million barrels are allocated to crude oil storage with the remaining 6.5 million barrels allocated to intermediates and products. 18 Energy and Other Utilities. Under normal operating conditions, the Torrance refinery consumes approximately 47,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas supplied via pipeline from third parties. The Torrance refinery generates some power internally using a combination of steam and gas turbines and purchases any additional needed power from the local utility. The Torrance refinery has a long term contract to purchase hydrogen from a third party supplier. Logistics Segment We formed PBFX, a publicly traded MLP, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX operations are aggregated into the Logistics segment. PBFX engages in the receiving, handling, storage and transferring of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and intermediates from sources located throughout the United States and Canada for PBF Energy in support of its refineries, as well as for third party customers. A substantial majority of PBFX revenues is derived from long term, fee based commercial agreements with PBF Holding, which include minimum volume commitments for receiving, handling, storing and transferring crude oil, refined products and natural gas. PBFX third party revenue is primarily derived from its third party acquisitions. PBF Energy also has agreements with PBFX that establish fees for certain general and administrative services and operational and maintenance services provided by PBF Holding to PBFX. These transactions, other than those with third parties, are eliminated by PBF Energy and PBF LLC in consolidation.

Such transactions occurring in the 3 years ended December 31, 2019 are discussed below. On April 24, 2019, PBFX entered into the TVPC Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which PBF LLC contributed to PBFX all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of TVP Holding for total consideration of $200.0 million in cash. Prior to the TVPC Acquisition, TVP Holding owned a 50% membership interest in TVPC. Subsequent to the closing of the TVPC Acquisition on May 31, 2019, PBFX owns 100% of the membership interests in TVPC. The transaction was financed through a combination of proceeds from the 2019 Registered Direct Offering (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ) and borrowings under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility. On July 16, 2018, PBFX entered into four contribution agreements with PBF LLC, pursuant to which PBF LLC contributed all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of the Development Assets to PBFX effective July 31, 2018 (the Development Assets Contribution Agreements ). In consideration for the Development Assets limited liability company interests, PBFX delivered to PBF LLC total consideration of $316 million consisting of 1,494,134 common units of PBFX. On February 15, 2017, PBFX entered into a contribution agreement ( the PNGPC Contribution Agreement ) between PBFX and PBF LLC. Pursuant to the PNGPC Contribution Agreement, PBF LLC contributed to PBFX wholly owned subsidiary, PBFX Operating Company LLC ( PBFX Op Co ), all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC ( PNGPC ). PNGPC owns and operates an existing interstate natural gas pipeline that originates in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at an interconnection with Texas Eastern pipeline that runs under the Delaware River and terminates at the delivery point to PBF Holding Paulsboro refinery, and is subject to regulation by the FERC. In connection with the PNGPC Contribution Agreement, PBFX constructed a new 24 pipeline to replace the existing pipeline, which commenced services in August 2017. In consideration for the PNGPC limited liability company interests, PBFX delivered to PBF LLC (i) an $116 million intercompany promissory note in favor of Paulsboro Refining, a wholly owned subsidiary of PBF Holding, (ii) an expansion rights and right of first refusal agreement in favor of PBF LLC with respect to the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline and (iii) an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to certain outstanding litigation involving PNGPC and the existing pipeline. Effective February 2017, PBF Holding and PBFX Op Co entered into a ten year storage services agreement under which PBFX, through PBFX Op Co, began providing storage services to PBF Holding commencing on November 1, 2017 upon the completion of the construction of a new crude tank with a shell capacity of 625,000 barrels at PBF Holding Chalmette refinery. PBFX Op Co and Chalmette Refining have entered into a twenty year lease for the premises upon which the tank is located and a project management agreement pursuant to which Chalmette Refining managed the construction of the tank. In connection with the foregoing transactions and other transactions with PBFX, PBF Holding entered into commercial agreements with PBFX entities for the provision of services which require minimum monthly throughput volumes. Subsequent to the transactions described above, as of December 31, 2019 , PBF LLC holds a 48.2% limited partner interest in PBFX consisting of 29,953,631 common units. PBFX IDR Restructuring Agreement On February 28, 2019, PBFX closed the IDR Restructuring Agreement with PBF GP, pursuant to which the IDRs held by PBF LLC were canceled and converted into 10,000,000 newly issued PBFX common units. Subsequent to the closing of the IDR Restructuring, no distributions were made to PBF LLC with respect to the IDRs and the newly issued PBFX common units are entitled to normal distributions by PBFX. 21 Principal Products Our refineries make various grades of gasoline, distillates (including diesel fuel, jet fuel and ULSD) and other products from crude oil, other feedstocks, and blending comp1nts. We sell these products through our commercial accounts, and sales with major oil companies. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , gasoline and distillates accounted for 86.8% , 84.7% and 84.1% of our revenues, respectively. Customers We sell a variety of refined products to a diverse customer base. The majority of our refined products are primarily sold through short term contracts or on the spot market. However, we do have product offtake arrangements for a portion of our clean products. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total trade accounts receivable. Seasonality Demand for gasoline and diesel is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. Decreased demand during the winter months can lower gasoline and diesel prices. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters may be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. Refining margins remain volatile and our results of operations may not reflect these historical seasonal trends. Additionally, the degree of seasonality may differ by the geographic areas in which we operate. Most of the effects of seasonality on PBFX operating results are mitigated through fee based commercial agreements with PBF Holding that include minimum volume commitments. Competition The refining business is very competitive. We compete directly with various other refining companies on the East, Gulf and West Coasts and in the Mid Continent, with integrated oil companies, with foreign refiners that import products into the United States and with producers and marketers in other industries supplying alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Some of our competitors have expanded the capacity of their refineries and internationally new refineries are coming on line which could also affect our competitive position. Profitability in the refining industry depends largely on refined product margins, which can fluctuate significantly, as well as crude oil prices and differentials between the prices of different grades of crude oil, operating efficiency and reliability, product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation. Certain of our competitors that have larger and more complex refineries may be able to realize lower per barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of feedstocks or intense price fluctuations. Refining margins are frequently impacted by sharp changes in crude oil costs, which may not be immediately reflected in product prices. The refining industry is highly competitive with respect to feedstock supply. Unlike certain of our competitors that have access to proprietary controlled sources of crude oil production available for use at their own refineries, we obtain all of our crude oil and substantially all other feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. The availability and cost of crude oil and feedstock are affected by global supply and demand. We have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil. We believe, however, that we will be able to obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at generally competitive prices for the foreseeable future. 22 Our complex refinery system and sourcing optionality may position us favorably to benefit from changes in certain market conditions and governmental or industry regulations, such as the recently instituted requirement from the IMO related to the reduction in sulfur content of marine fuels to a maximum of 0.5% effective January 1, 2020. Due to our relative refinery complexity and ample coking capacity, we anticipate being able to favorably capture the benefit from potential product margin uplift associated with an increase in demand for low sulfur fuel or a widening of the discount on high sulfur feedstocks as a result of the new IMO regulations.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies 26 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry You should carefully read the risks and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only 1s facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of PBF Energy Class A common stock could fall. The price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, cash flows and liquidity. Our revenues, profitability, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil, intermediate partially refined petroleum products, and natural gas liquids that are processed and blended into refined products) at which we are able to sell refined products. Refining is primarily a margin based business and, to increase profitability, it is important to maximize the yields of high value finished products while minimizing the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs contracts, our earnings, profitability and cash flows are negatively affected. Refining margins historically have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, as a result of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services. An increase or decrease in the price of crude oil will likely result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products; however, there may be a time lag in the realization, or no such realization, of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on our refining margins therefore depends in part on how quickly and how fully refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes. In addition, the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories. Because crude oil, feedstock and refined products are commodities, we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories. Our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last in first out ( LIFO ) inventory valuation methodology. If the market value of our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventory declines to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write down of inventory and a non cash impact to cost of products and other. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2019 , we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which increased income from operations and net income by $250.2 million and $188.0 million, respectively, reflecting the net change in the LCM inventory reserve from $6518 million at December 31, 2018 to $4016 million at December 31, 2019 . Prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, ethanol, asphalt and other refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by a variety of economic, market, environmental and political conditions. Our direct operating expense structure also impacts our profitability. Our major direct operating expenses include employee and contract labor, maintenance and energy. Our predominant variable direct operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of fuel and other utility services. The volatility in costs of fuel, principally natural gas, and other utility services, principally electricity, used by our refineries and other operations affect our operating costs. Fuel and utility prices have been, and will continue to be, affected by factors outside our control, such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets. Natural gas prices have historically been volatile and, typically, electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices. Future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our refining margins, profitability and cash flows. 27 Our profitability is affected by crude oil differentials and related factors, which fluctuate substantially. A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been less expensive than benchmark crude oils, such as the heavy, sour crude oils processed at our Delaware City, Paulsboro, Chalmette and Torrance refineries. For our Toledo refinery, aside from recent crude differential volatility, purchased crude prices have historically been slightly above the WTI benchmark, however, such crude slate typically results in favorable refinery production yield. For all locations, these crude oil differentials can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products. Any change in these crude oil differentials may have an impact on our earnings. Our rail investment and strategy to acquire cost advantaged Mid Continent and Canadian crude, which are priced based on WTI, could be adversely affected when the Dated Brent WTI or related differentials narrow. A narrowing of the WTI Dated Brent differential may result in our Toledo refinery losing a portion of its crude oil price advantage over certain of our competitors, which negatively impacts our profitability. In addition, efforts in Canada to control the imbalance between its production and capacity to export crude may continue to result in price volatility and the narrowing of the WTI WCS differential, which is a proxy for the difference between light U.S. and heavy Canadian crude oil, and may reduce our refining margins and adversely affect our profitability and earnings. Divergent views have been expressed as to the expected magnitude of changes to these crude differentials in future periods. Any continued or further narrowing of these differentials could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. Additionally, governmental and regulatory actions, including continued resolutions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict crude oil production levels and executive actions by the current U.S. presidential administration to advance certain energy infrastructure projects such as the Keyst1 XL pipeline, may continue to impact crude oil prices and crude oil differentials. Any increase in crude oil prices or unfavorable movements in crude oil differentials due to such actions or changing regulatory environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire crude oil at economical prices and could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. A significant interruption or casualty loss at any of our refineries and related assets could reduce our production, particularly if not fully covered by our insurance. Failure by 1 or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results and financial condition. Our business currently consists of owning and operating six refineries and related assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if any of our refineries were to experience a major accident, be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster, or otherwise be forced to shut down or curtail production due to unforeseen events, such as acts of God, nature, orders of governmental authorities, supply chain disruptions impacting our crude rail facilities or other logistics assets, power outages, acts of terrorism, fires, toxic emissions and maritime hazards. Any such shutdown or disruption would reduce the production from that refinery. There is also risk of mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns both in general and following unforeseen events. Further, in such situations, undamaged refinery processing units may be dependent on or interact with damaged sections of our refineries and, accordingly, are also subject to being shut down. In the event any of our refineries is forced to shut down for a significant period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our earnings, our other results of operations and our financial condition as a whole. As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage can be limited, and coverage for terrorism risks can include broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 28 Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies and, therefore, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. Our refineries are subject to interruptions of supply and distribution as a result of our reliance on pipelines and railroads for transportation of crude oil and refined products. Our Toledo, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries receive a significant portion of their crude oil through pipelines. These pipelines include the Enbridge system, Capline and Mid Valley pipelines for supplying crude to our Toledo refinery, the MOEM Pipeline and CAM Pipeline for supplying crude to our Chalmette refinery and the San Joaquin Pipeline, San Pablo Bay Pipeline, San Ardo and Coastal Pipeline systems for supplying crude to our Torrance and Martinez refineries. Additionally, our Toledo, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries deliver a significant portion of the refined products through pipelines. These pipelines include pipelines such as the Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and Buckeye Partners L.P. pipelines at Toledo, the Collins Pipeline at our Chalmette refinery, the Jet Pipeline to the Los Angeles International Airport, the Product Pipeline to Vernon and the Product Pipeline to A2od at our Torrance refinery and the KinderMorgan SFPP North Pipeline at our Martinez refinery. We could experience an interruption of supply or delivery, or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market, if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, weather interruptions, governmental regulation, terrorism, other third party action or casualty or other events. The Delaware City rail unloading facilities and the East Coast Storage Assets, allow our East Coast refineries to source WTI based crudes from Western Canada and the Mid Continent, which may provide significant cost advantages versus traditional Brent based international crudes in certain market environments. Any disruptions or restrictions to our supply of crude by rail due to problems with third party logistics infrastructure or operations or as a result of increased regulations, could increase our crude costs and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, due to the common carrier regulatory obligation applicable to interstate oil pipelines, capacity allocation among shippers can become contentious in the event demand is in excess of capacity. Therefore, nominations by new shippers or increased nominations by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for transportation of crude oil and refined products could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to (i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or clean energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing federal CAA. EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and trade systems and renewable portfolio standards (such as AB32). Efforts have also been undertaken to delay, limit or prohibit EPA and possibly state action to regulate GHG emissions, and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In addition, it is currently uncertain how the current presidential administration or future administrations will address GHG emissions. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Such requirements also could adversely affect 29 demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Requirements to reduce emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs put in place. For example, AB32 in California requires the state to reduce its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Additionally, in September 2016, the state of California enacted Senate Bill 32 which further reduces greenhouse gas emissions targets to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. 2 regulations implemented to achieve these goals are Cap and Trade and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard ( LCFS ). In 2012, CARB implemented Cap and Trade. This program currently places a cap on GHGs and we are required to acquire a sufficient number of credits to cover emissions from our refineries and our in state sales of gasoline and diesel. In 2009, CARB adopted the LCFS, which requires a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel by 2020 . Compliance is achieved through blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each of these programs is facilitated through a market based credit system. If sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase or we are unable to pass through costs to our customers, we have to pay a higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully integrate the recently acquired Martinez Refinery into our business, or realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition. The integration of the recently acquired Martinez refinery into our operations may be a complex and time consuming process that may not be successful. Even if we successfully integrate this business into our operations, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and operating synergies. Our estimates regarding the earnings, operating cash flow, capital expenditures and liabilities resulting from this acquisition may prove to be incorrect. This acquisition involves risks, including unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired operations; challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; diversion of management time and attention from our existing business; liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results; and the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets. In connection with the Martinez Acquisition, we did not have access to the type of historical financial information that we may require regarding the prior operation of the refinery. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to evaluate the probable impact of this acquisition on our financial performance until we have operated the acquired refinery for a substantial period of time. A cyber attack on, or other failure of, our technology infrastructure could affect our business and assets, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are becoming increasingly dependent on our technology infrastructure and certain critical information systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely and effectively operate our respective assets and businesses. These information systems include data ne2rk and telecommunications, internet access, our websites, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our refineries and logistics assets. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our technology infrastructure and information systems. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, cyber attacks, which may render data systems unusable, and physical threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure. Additionally, our business is highly dependent on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems, including our enterprise resource planning tools. We process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and 30 rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems. Furthermore, we rely on information systems across our respective operations, including the management of supply chain and various other processes and transactions. As a result, a disruption on any information systems at our refineries or logistics assets, may cause disruptions to our collective operations. The potential for such security threats or system failures has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software, emergency recovery processes and a formal disaster recovery plan to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe, and our formal disaster recovery plan and other implemented measures may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. If a key system were hacked or otherwise interfered with by an unauthorized user, or were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, or any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, it could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, damage our reputation and subject us to additional costs and liabilities. Cyber attacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, and U.S. government warnings have indicated that infrastructure assets, including pipelines, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. These attacks include, without limitation, malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches. These attacks may be perpetrated by state sponsored groups, hacktivists , criminal organizations or private individuals (including employee malfeasance). Current efforts by the federal government, such as the Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Ne2rks and Critical Infrastructure executive order, and any potential future regulations could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations. Further, our business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur. We do not carry insurance specifically for cybersecurity events; however, certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage for a cyber event resulting in ensuing property damage from an otherwise insured peril. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. Our hedging activities may limit our potential gains, exacerbate potential losses and involve other risks. We may enter into commodity derivatives contracts to hedge our crude price risk or crack spread risk with respect to a portion of our expected gasoline and distillate production on a rolling basis or to hedge our exposure to the price of natural gas, which is a significant comp1nt of our refinery operating expenses. Consistent with that policy we may hedge some percentage of our future crude and natural gas supply. We may enter into hedging arrangements with the intent to secure a minimum fixed cash flow stream on the volume of products hedged during the hedge term and to protect against volatility in commodity prices. Our hedging arrangements may fail to fully achieve these objectives for a variety of reasons, including our failure to have adequate hedging arrangements, if any, in effect at any particular time and the failure of our hedging arrangements to produce the anticipated results. We may not be able to procure adequate hedging arrangements due to a variety of factors. Moreover, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in crude oil, refined product and natural gas prices. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the volumes of our actual use of crude oil or natural gas or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement; accidents, interruptions in feedstock transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries, or those of our suppliers or customers; changes in commodity prices have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our hedging arrangements, resulting in us being subject to margin calls; the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or 31 a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement. As a result, the effectiveness of our hedging strategy could have a material impact on our financial results. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition, these hedging activities involve basis risk. Basis risk in a hedging arrangement occurs when the price of the commodity we hedge is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged commodity is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. For example, a NYMEX index used for hedging certain volumes of our crude oil or refined products may have more or less variability than the actual cost or price we realize for such crude oil or refined products. We may not hedge all the basis risk inherent in our hedging arrangements and derivative contracts. We may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and long term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or our future debt obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, including acquisitions, in which case our operations may not perform as we currently expect. We have substantial short term capital needs and may have substantial long term capital needs. Our short term working capital needs are primarily related to financing certain of our crude oil and refined products inventory not covered by our various supply and Inventory Intermediation Agreements. If we cannot adequately handle our crude oil and feedstock requirements or if we are required to obtain our crude oil supply at our other refineries without the benefit of the existing supply arrangements or the applicable counterparty defaults in its obligations, our crude oil pricing costs may increase as the number of days between when we pay for the crude oil and when the crude oil is delivered to us increases. Termination of our Inventory Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron would require us to finance the J. Aron Products covered by the agreements at terms that may not be as favorable. Additionally, we are obligated to repurchase from J. Aron all volumes of the J. Aron Products upon termination of these agreements, which may have a material adverse impact on our working capital and financial condition. Further, if we are not able to market and sell our finished products to credit worthy customers, we may be subject to delays in the collection of our accounts receivable and exposure to additional credit risk. Such increased exposure could negatively impact our liquidity due to our increased working capital needs as a result of the increase in the amount of crude oil inventory and accounts receivable we would have to carry on our balance sheet. Our long term needs for cash include those to support ongoing capital expenditures for equipment maintenance and upgrades during turnarounds at our refineries and to complete our routine and normally scheduled maintenance, regulatory and security expenditures. In addition, from time to time, we are required to spend significant amounts for repairs when 1 or more processing units experiences temporary shutdowns. We continue to utilize significant capital to upgrade equipment, improve facilities, and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. In connection with the Paulsboro and Torrance acquisitions, we assumed certain significant environmental obligations, and may similarly do so in future acquisitions. We will likely incur substantial compliance costs in connection with new or changing environmental, health and safety regulations. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our liquidity condition will affect our ability to satisfy any and all of these needs or obligations. We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs. In the past, global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and may again be, subject to disruption and volatile due to a variety of factors, including uncertainty in the financial services sector, low consumer confidence, falling commodity prices, geopolitical issues and generally weak economic conditions. In addition, 32 the fixed income markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility that have negatively impacted market liquidity conditions. As a result, the cost of raising m1y in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially at times while the availability of funds from those markets diminished significantly. In particular, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, which may be subject to unforeseen disruptions, the cost of obtaining m1y from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due. Moreover, without adequate funding, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, complete future acquisitions, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Competition from companies who produce their own supply of feedstocks, have extensive retail outlets, make alternative fuels or have greater financial and other resources than we do could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in regions of the United States in which we operate, as well as with domestic refiners in other regions and foreign refiners that import products into the United States. In addition, we compete with other refiners, producers and marketers in other industries that supply their own renewable fuels or alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Certain of our competitors have larger and more complex refineries, and may be able to realize lower per barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain substantially all of our feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. We are not engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. We do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of crude oil supply and other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations. Newer or upgraded refineries will often be more efficient than our refineries, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We have taken significant measures to maintain our refineries including the installation of new equipment and redesigning older equipment to improve our operations. However, these actions involve significant uncertainties, since upgraded equipment may not perform at expected throughput levels, the yield and product quality of new equipment may differ from design specifications and modifications may be needed to correct equipment that does not perform as expected. Any of these risks associated with new equipment, redesigned older equipment or repaired equipment could lead to lower revenues or higher costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. Over time, our refineries or certain refinery units may become obsolete, or be unable to compete, because of the construction of new, more efficient facilities by our competitors. A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations. Most hourly employees at our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements through the USW, the IOW and the IBEW. These agreements are predominantly scheduled to expire on various dates in 2021 and 2022 (See Item 1 Business Employees). Future negotiations prior to the expiration of our collective agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and or work stoppages could negatively affect our operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses at the refineries. 33 Any political instability, military strikes, sustained military campaigns, terrorist activity, changes in foreign policy, or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any political instability, military strikes, sustained military campaigns, terrorist activity, changes in foreign policy in areas or regions of the world where we acquire crude oil and other raw materials or sell our refined petroleum products may affect our business in unpredictable ways, including forcing us to increase security measures and causing disruptions of supplies and distribution markets. We may also be subject to United States trade and economic sanctions laws, which change frequently as a result of foreign policy developments, and which may necessitate changes to our crude oil acquisition activities. Further, like other industrial companies, our facilities may be the target of terrorist activities or subject to catastrophic events such as natural disasters and pandemic illness. Any act of war, terrorism, or other catastrophic events that resulted in damage to, or otherwise disrupts the operating activities of, any of our refineries or third party facilities upon which we are dependent for our business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Economic turmoil in the global financial system or an economic slowdown or recession in the future may have an adverse impact on the refining industry. Our business and profitability are affected by the overall level of demand for our products, which in turn is affected by factors such as overall levels of economic activity and business and consumer confidence and spending. In the past, declines in global economic activity and consumer and business confidence and spending significantly reduced the level of demand for our products. In addition, macroeconomic trends, such as economic recession, inflation, unemployment and interest rates or unexpected catastrophic events such as natural disasters or pandemic illness, can affect the level of demand for our products. Reduced demand for our products may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, downturns in the economy impact the demand for refined fuels and, in turn, result in excess refining capacity. Refining margins are impacted by changes in domestic and global refining capacity, as increases in refining capacity can adversely impact refining margins, earnings and cash flows. Our business is indirectly exposed to risks faced by our suppliers, customers and other business partners. The impact on these constituencies of the risks posed by economic turmoil in the global financial system could include interruptions or delays in the performance by counterparties to our contracts, reductions and delays in customer purchases, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products and the inability of customers to pay for our products. Any of these events may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We must make substantial capital expenditures on our operating facilities to maintain their reliability and efficiency. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities (or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment, including turnarounds) could adversely affect our ability to achieve targeted internal rates of return and operating results. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including denial or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals and or permits; unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; disruptions in transportation of modular comp1nts and or construction materials; severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers; shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; market related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs; and or 34 non performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub contractors involved with a project. Our refineries contain many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. Equipment, even if properly maintained, may require significant capital expenditures and expenses to keep it operating at optimum efficiency. 1 or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds for such units. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues during the period of time that the units are not operating. Our forecasted internal rates of return are also based upon our projections of future market fundamentals, which are not within our control, including changes in general economic conditions, impact of new regulations, available alternative supply and customer demand. Any 1 or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our business. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Acquisitions that we may undertake in the future involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits. We may not be successful in acquiring additional assets, and any acquisitions that we do consummate may not produce the anticipated benefits or may have adverse effects on our business and operating results. We may selectively consider strategic acquisitions in the future within the refining and mid stream sector based on performance through the cycle, advantageous access to crude oil supplies, attractive refined products market fundamentals and access to distribution and logistics infrastructure. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth and many other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to the diversion of management time and attention from our existing business, liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets. We may also enter into transition services agreements in the future with sellers of any additional refineries we acquire. Such services may not be performed timely and effectively, and any significant disruption in such transition services or unanticipated costs related to such services could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, it is likely that, when we acquire refineries, we will not have access to the type of historical financial information that we will require regarding the prior operation of the refineries. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to evaluate the probable impact of significant acquisitions on our financial performance until we have operated the acquired refineries for a substantial period of time. Our business may suffer if any of our senior executives or other key employees discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity. Our future success depends to a large extent on the services of our senior executives and other key employees. Our business depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified employees in all areas of our operations, including engineering, accounting, business operations, finance and other key back office and mid office personnel. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced employees with proficiency in multiple tasks. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these executives or employees could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. 35 Our commodity derivative activities could result in period to period earnings volatility. We do not currently apply hedge accounting to any of our commodity derivative contracts and, as a result, unrealized gains and losses will be charged to our earnings based on the increase or decrease in the market value of such unsettled positions. These gains and losses may be reflected in our income statement in periods that differ from when the settlement of the underlying hedged Item are reflected in our income statement. Such derivative gains or losses in earnings may produce significant period to period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of our underlying operational performance. We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the use and or handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and the health and safety of the surrounding community. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent over time, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean up costs for past or future spills, discharges or releases, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Environmental clean up and remediation costs of our sites and environmental litigation could decrease our net cash flow, reduce our results of operations and impair our financial condition. We are subject to liability for the investigation and clean up of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off site locations where we arrange for the treatment or disposal of regulated materials. We may become involved in litigation or other proceedings related to the foregoing. If we were to be held responsible for damages in any such litigation or proceedings, such costs may not be covered by insurance and may be material. Historical soil and groundwater contamination has been identified at our refineries. Currently, remediation projects for such contamination are underway in accordance with regulatory requirements at our refineries. In connection with the acquisitions of certain of our refineries and logistics assets, the prior owners have retained certain liabilities or indemnified us for certain liabilities, including those relating to pre acquisition soil and groundwater conditions, and in some instances we have assumed certain liabilities and environmental obligations, including certain existing and potential remediation obligations. If the prior owners fail to satisfy their obligations for any reason, or if significant liabilities arise in the areas in which we assumed liability, we may become responsible for remediation expenses and other environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. As a result, in addition to making capital expenditures or incurring other costs to comply with environmental laws, we also may be liable for significant environmental litigation or for investigation and remediation costs and other liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of these assets by prior owners, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of 36 Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Item 1 Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters. We may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, or other per and polyfluoroalkyl substances, asbestos, benzene, silica dust and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contamination from our properties. A significant increase in the number or success of these claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Product liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Product liability is a significant commercial risk. Substantial damage awards have been made in certain jurisdictions against manufacturers and resellers based upon claims for injuries and property damage caused by the use of or exposure to various products. Failure of our products to meet required specifications or claims that a product is inherently defective could result in product liability claims from our shippers and customers, and also arise from contaminated or off specification product in commingled pipelines and storage tanks and or defective fuels. Product liability claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Climate change could have a material adverse impact on our operations and adversely affect our facilities. Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. We believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention, with the potential for further laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect our ongoing operations. In addition, as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products. Extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation. We could also incur substantial costs to protect or repair these facilities. Renewable fuels mandates may reduce demand for the refined fuels we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The market prices for RINs have been volatile and may harm our profitability. Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, EPA has issued Renewable Fuel Standards, or RFS, implementing mandates to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels produced and sold in the United States. Under RFS, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated refineries must blend into their finished petroleum fuels increases annually over time until 2022 In addition, certain states have passed legislation that requires minimum biodiesel blending in finished distillates. On October 13, 2010, EPA raised the maximum amount of ethanol allowed under federal law from 10% to 15% for cars and light trucks manufactured since 2007. The maximum amount allowed under federal law currently remains at 10% ethanol for all other vehicles. Existing laws and regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels may increase. Because we do not produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into our products displaces an increasing volume of our refinery product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and profitability. In addition, in order to meet certain of these and future EPA requirements, we may be required to purchase RINs, which may have fluctuating costs. We incurred approximately $1227 million in RINs costs during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1439 million and $2937 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The fluctuations in our RINs costs are due primarily to volatility in prices for ethanol linked RINs and increases in our production of on road transportation fuels since 2012 Our RINs purchase obligation is dependent on our actual 37 shipment of on road transportation fuels domestically and the amount of blending achieved which can cause variability in our profitability. Our pipelines are subject to federal and or state regulations, which could reduce profitability and the amount of cash we generate. Our transportation activities are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the United States Department of Transportation ( DOT ), and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or what impact such proposals may have. Projected operating costs related to our pipelines reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations, and these costs may increase due to future acquisitions, changes in regulation, changes in use, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues. We are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding employee and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration ( OSHA ), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local residents. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, process safety standards and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the cash flows of the business if we are subjected to significant fines or compliance costs. Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, local and foreign taxes such as income, excise, sales use, payroll, franchise, property, gross receipts, withholding and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. These liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authorities, which could increase our tax liabilities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may also subject us to interest and penalties. There can be no certainty that our federal, state, local or foreign taxes could be passed on to our customers. Changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business. Changes in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms for our purchases or require us to post security or letters of credit prior to payment. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, any imposition by our suppliers of more burdensome payment terms on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This, in turn, could cause us to be unable to operate 1 or more of our refineries at full capacity. Changes in laws or standards affecting the transportation of North American crude oil by rail could significantly impact our operations, and as a result cause our costs to increase. Investigations into past rail accidents involving the transport of crude oil have prompted government agencies and other interested parties to call for increased regulation of the transport of crude oil by rail including in the areas of crude oil constituents, rail car design, routing of trains and other matters. Regulation governing shipments of petroleum crude oil by rail requires shippers to properly test and classify petroleum crude oil and further requires shippers to treat Class 3 petroleum crude oil transported by rail in tank cars as a Packing Group I or II hazardous material only, which creates further classification and testing requirements, along with more severe penalties for 38 violations. The DOT issued additional rules and regulations that require rail carriers to provide certain notifications to State agencies along routes utilized by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil, enhance safety training standards under the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, require each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews and establish enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for high hazard flammable trains. These rules and any further changes in law, regulations or industry standards that require us to reduce the volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, alter the design or standards for rail cars we use, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail to our, or subsequently to third party, refineries, could increase our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness. We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. These authorizations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal or modification and can require operational changes to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and or health and safety. A violation of authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions, and or facility shutdowns. In addition, major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur significant liabilities under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations, which are complex and change frequently. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for, costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness. Our indebtedness may significantly affect our financial flexibility in the future. As of December 31, 2019 , we have total debt of $2,097.3 million , excluding unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $324 million and our PBF LLC Affiliate note payable with PBF Energy that eliminates in consolidation at the PBF Energy level, and we could incur an additional $1,6735 million under our credit facilities. As disclosed in Note 25 Subsequent Events of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we incurred additional debt in conjunction with the 39 issuance of an aggregate $10 billion of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due 2028 by PBF Holding in January 2020 (the 2028 Senior Notes ), and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our strategy may include executing future refinery and logistics acquisitions. Any significant acquisition would likely require us to incur additional indebtedness in order to finance all or a portion of such acquisition. The level of our indebtedness has several important consequences for our future operations, including that a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes; under certain circumstances, covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets and make certain investments; in certain circumstances these covenants also require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry, such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and we may be at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less leveraged; and we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions. Our indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations, certain of which contain cross default and or cross acceleration provisions. Our, and our subsidiaries , ability to meet future principal obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing. Refinancing may not be possible and additional financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Despite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future including additional secured or unsecured debt. Although our debt instruments and financing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the leverage risks described above would increase. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions. Various covenants in our debt instruments and other financing arrangements may restrict our and our subsidiaries financial flexibility in a number of ways. Our indebtedness subjects us to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments and investments, consummate certain asset sales or asset swaps, conduct businesses other than our current businesses, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Some of these debt instruments also require our subsidiaries to satisfy or maintain certain financial tests in certain circumstances. Our subsidiaries ability to meet these financial tests can be affected by events beyond our control and they may not meet such tests in the future. Provisions in our indentures could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party. Certain provisions of our indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change of control as described in the indentures governing the 2025 Senior Notes (as defined below), the 2028 Senior Notes and the PBFX 2023 Senior Notes (as defined below and in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 40 of Operations ), holders of our notes could require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, at the date of repurchase. Our future credit ratings could adversely affect the cost of our borrowing as well as our ability to obtain credit in the future. On January 24, 2020, PBF Holding issued the 2028 Senior Notes. The proceeds from this offering were used in part to subsequently redeem its outstanding 7.00% senior notes due 2023 (the 2023 Senior Notes ). The 2028 Senior Notes and our 7.25% senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes ) are rated B1 by Moody Investors Service Inc., BB by Standard & Poor Financial Services LLC, and BB by Fitch Ratings, Inc. Any adverse effect on our credit rating may increase our cost of borrowing or hinder our ability to raise financing in the capital markets, which would impair our ability to grow our business and make cash distributions to our shareholders. The discontinuation of LIBOR, and the adoption of an alternative reference rate, may have a material adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs. We are subject to interest rate risk on floating interest rate borrowings under PBF Holding asset based revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility ), the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility and the PBF Rail Term Loan (as defined in Note 9 Credit Facilities and Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These borrowings have the optionality to use London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR ) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to LIBOR) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Although the full impact of the transition away from LIBOR, including the discontinuance of LIBOR publication and the adoption of SOFR as the replacement rate for LIBOR, remains unclear, these changes may have an adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs. Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure and PBF Energy Class A Common Stock PBF Energy is the managing member of PBF LLC and its only material asset is its interest in PBF LLC. Accordingly, PBF Energy depends upon distributions from PBF LLC and its subsidiaries to pay its taxes, meet its other obligations and or pay dividends in the future. PBF Energy is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through subsidiaries of PBF LLC. PBF Energy has no independent means of generating revenue and no material assets other than its ownership interest in PBF LLC. We depend on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including our indebtedness, tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under a tax receivable agreement entered into with PBF LLC Series A and PBF LLC Series B unitholders (the Tax Receivable Agreement ). If we do not receive such cash distributions, dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our obligations and or pay dividends. PBF Energy, as the sole managing partner of PBF LLC, may cause PBF LLC to make distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to enable PBF Energy to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, to make payments owed by PBF Energy under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and to pay other obligations and dividends, if any, declared by PBF Energy. To the extent we need funds and any of our subsidiaries is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing or other contractual arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, such restrictions could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 41 The Revolving Credit Facility, the 2028 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes, and certain of our other outstanding debt arrangements include a restricted payment covenant, which restricts the ability of PBF Holding to make distributions to us, and we anticipate our future debt will contain a similar restriction. PBFX Revolving Credit Facility and PBFX indenture governing its PBFX 2023 Senior Notes also contain covenants that limit or restrict PBFX ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to make distributions and other restricted payments and restrict PBFX ability to incur liens and enter into burdensome agreements. In addition, there may be restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. For example, PBF Holding is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of the limited liability company (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets, and PBFX is subject to a similar prohibition. As a result, we may be unable to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligations and make payments to PBF Energy stockholders, if any. The rights of other members of PBF LLC may conflict with the interests of PBF Energy Class A common stockholders. The interests of the other members of PBF LLC, which include current and former directors and officers, may not in all cases be aligned with PBF Energy Class A common stockholders interests. For example, these members may have different tax positions which could influence their positions, including regarding whether and when we dispose of assets and whether and when we incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to PBF Energy Class A common stockholders or us. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions IPO Related Agreements in our 2020 Proxy Statement incorporated herein by reference. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, PBF Energy is required to pay the former and current holders of PBF LLC Series A Units and PBF LLC Series B Units for certain realized or assumed tax benefits PBF Energy may claim arising in connection with prior offerings and future exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of its Class A common stock and related transactions. The indentures governing the senior notes allow PBF LLC, under certain circumstances, to make distributions sufficient for PBF Energy to pay its obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and such amounts are expected to be substantial. PBF Energy is party to a Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment from time to time by PBF Energy to the current and former holders of PBF LLC Series A Units and PBF LLC Series B Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that PBF Energy is deemed to realize as a result of (i) the increases in tax basis resulting from its acquisitions of PBF LLC Series A Units, including such acquisitions in connection with its prior offerings or in the future and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to its entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. We expect that the payments that PBF Energy may make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. As of December 31, 2019 , PBF Energy has recognized a liability for the Tax Receivable Agreement of $3735 million reflecting PBF Energy estimate of the undiscounted amounts that it expects to pay under the agreement due to exchanges that occurred prior to that date, and to range over the next five years from approximately $130 million to $86.0 million per year and decline thereafter. Future payments by PBF Energy in respect of subsequent exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be material as well. If PBF Energy does not have taxable income, PBF Energy generally is not required (absent a change of control or circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for that taxable year because no benefit will have been actually realized. However, any tax benefits that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The utilization of such tax attributes will result in payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The foregoing numbers are merely estimates based on assumptions that are subject to change due to various factors, including, among other factors, the timing of exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock as contemplated by the Tax Receivable 42 Agreement, the price of PBF Energy Class A common stock at the time of such exchanges, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, and the amount and timing of PBF Energy income. The actual payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, (i) the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits PBF Energy realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and or (ii) distributions to PBF Energy by PBF LLC are not sufficient to permit PBF Energy, after it has paid its taxes and other obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditi1d upon any recipient continued ownership of us. In certain cases, payments by PBF Energy under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and or significantly exceed the actual benefits it realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. These provisions may deter a change in control of the Company. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides that upon certain changes of control, or if, at any time, PBF Energy elects an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, PBF Energy (or its successor s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired PBF LLC Series A Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including (i) that PBF Energy would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) that the subsidiaries of PBF LLC will sell certain nonamortizable assets (and realize certain related tax benefits) no later than a specified date. Moreover, in each of these instances, PBF Energy would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value (at a discount rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits (based on the foregoing assumptions). Accordingly, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated future tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the actual benefits PBF Energy realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Assuming that the market value of a share of PBF Energy Class A common stock equals $3137 per share (the closing price on December 31, 2019 ) and that LIBOR were to be 185% , we estimate that, as of December 31, 2019 the aggregate amount of these accelerated payments would have been approximately $326.9 million if triggered immediately on such date. In these situations, PBF Energy obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. PBF Energy may not be able to finance its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and its existing indebtedness may limit its subsidiaries ability to make distributions to PBF Energy to pay these obligations. These provisions may deter a potential sale of our Company to a third party and may otherwise make it less likely that a third party would enter into a change of control transaction with us. Moreover, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that PBF Energy determines in accordance with the Tax Receivable Agreement. PBF Energy will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if the Internal Revenue Service subsequently disallows part or all of the tax benefits that gave rise to such prior payments. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are significantly in excess of the benefits that PBF Energy actually realized in respect of (i) the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to PBF Energy entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. PBF Energy cannot assure you that it will continue to declare dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments. Although PBF Energy currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its Class A common stock, the declaration, amount and payment of any dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. PBF Energy is not obligated under any applicable laws, its governing documents or any contractual agreements with its existing and prior owners or otherwise to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions (other than the obligations of PBF LLC to make tax distributions to its members). Our board of directors may take into account, among other things, general economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash 43 and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, plans for expansion, including acquisitions, tax, legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions and implications, including under our subsidiaries outstanding debt documents, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in determining whether to declare or pay any dividend. Because PBF Energy is a holding company with no material assets (other than the equity interests of its direct subsidiary), its cash flow and ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of its indirect subsidiaries PBF Holding and PBFX and their respective operating subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of cash to it in the form of dividends or otherwise. The direct and indirect subsidiaries of PBF Energy are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make any funds available to it other than in the case of certain intercompany transactions. As a result, if PBF Energy does not declare or pay dividends you may not receive any return on an investment in PBF Energy Class A common stock unless you sell PBF Energy Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. Anti takeover and certain other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage or delay a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; prohibit stockholder action by written consent; restrict certain business combinations with stockholders who obtain beneficial ownership of a certain percentage of our outstanding common stock; provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the board of directors, and establish advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates for election as directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and provide that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 75% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote. These anti takeover provisions and other provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. Certain provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock. The market price of PBF Energy Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. The market price of PBF Energy Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations due to a number of factors including variations in actual or anticipated operating results or dividends, if any, to stockholders; changes in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates of securities analysts; market conditions in the oil refining industry and volatility in commodity prices; the impact of disruptions to crude or feedstock supply to any of our refineries, including disruptions due to problems with third party logistics infrastructure; litigation and government investigations; the timing and announcement of any potential acquisitions and subsequent impact of any future acquisitions on our capital structure, financial condition or results of operations; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof; general economic and stock market conditions; and the availability for sale, or sales by PBF Energy or its senior management, of a significant number of shares of its Class A common stock in the public market. 44 In addition, the stock markets generally may experience significant volatility, often unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies whose securities are publicly traded. These and other factors may cause the market price of PBF Energy Class A common stock to decrease significantly, which in turn would adversely affect the value of your investment. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. Risks Related to Our Ownership of PBFX We depend upon PBFX for a substantial portion of our refineries logistics needs and have obligations for minimum volume commitments in our commercial agreements with PBFX. We depend on PBFX to receive, handle, store and transfer crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas for us from our operations and sources located throughout the United States and Canada in support of certain of our refineries under long term, fee based commercial agreements with our subsidiaries. These commercial agreements have an initial term ranging from 1 to fifteen years and generally include minimum quarterly commitments and inflation escalators. If we fail to meet the minimum commitments during any calendar quarter, we will be required to make a shortfall payment quarterly to PBFX equal to the volume of the shortfall multiplied by the applicable fee. PBFX operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in receiving, handling, storing and transferring crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas, including damages to its facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism; mechanical or structural failures at PBFX facilities or at third party facilities on which its operations are dependent; curtailments of operations relative to severe seasonal weather; inadvertent damage to our facilities from construction, farm and utility equipment; and other hazards. Any of these events or factors could result in severe damage or destruction to PBFX assets or the temporary or permanent shut down of PBFX facilities. If PBFX is unable to serve our logistics needs, our ability to operate our refineries and receive crude oil and distribute products could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as of December 31, 2019 , PBF LLC owns 29,953,631 common units representing 48.2% limited partner interest in PBFX. The inability of PBFX to continue operations, perform under its commercial arrangements with our subsidiaries or the occurrence of any of these risks or operational hazards, could also adversely impact the value of our investment in PBFX and, because PBFX is a consolidated entity, our business, financial condition and results of operations. PBF Energy will be required to pay taxes on its share of taxable income from PBF LLC and its other subsidiary flow through entities (including PBFX), regardless of the amount of cash distributions PBF Energy receives from PBF LLC. The holders of limited liability company interests in PBF LLC, including PBF Energy, generally have to include for purposes of calculating their U.S. federal, state and local income taxes their share of any taxable income of PBF LLC, regardless of whether such holders receive cash distributions from PBF LLC. PBF Energy ultimately may not receive cash distributions from PBF LLC equal to its share of the taxable income of PBF LLC or even equal to the actual tax due with respect to that income. For example, PBF LLC is required to include in taxable income PBF LLC allocable share of PBFX taxable income and gains (such share to be determined pursuant to the partnership agreement of PBFX), regardless of the amount of cash distributions received by PBF LLC from PBFX, and such taxable income and gains will flow through to PBF Energy to the extent of its allocable share of the taxable income of PBF LLC. As a result, at certain times, the amount of cash otherwise ultimately available 45 to PBF Energy on account of its indirect interest in PBFX may not be sufficient for PBF Energy to pay the amount of taxes it will owe on account of its indirect interests in PBFX. If PBFX was to be treated as a corporation, rather than as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if PBFX was otherwise subject to entity level taxation, PBFX cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including to us, would be reduced, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of units, including the units held by us. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including PBFX, or an investment in its common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time the U.S. Congress considers substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that would affect publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for PBFX to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in PBFX common units. If PBFX were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would pay U.S. federal income tax on income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21% under the TCJA, and would likely be liable for state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to PBFX unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to PBFX unitholders. Because taxes would be imposed upon PBFX as a corporation, the cash available for distribution to PBFX unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, PBFX treatment as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to PBFX unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units. All of the executive officers and a majority of the directors of PBF GP are also current or former officers or directors of PBF Energy. Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of this arrangement. PBF Energy indirectly owns and controls PBF GP, and appoints all of its officers and directors. All of the executive officers and a majority of the directors of PBF GP are also current or former officers or directors of PBF Energy. These individuals will devote significant time to the business of PBFX. Although the directors and officers of PBF GP have a fiduciary duty to manage PBF GP in a manner that is beneficial to PBF Energy, as directors and officers of PBF GP they also have certain duties to PBFX and its unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between PBF Energy and its affiliates, including PBF GP, on the 1 hand, and PBFX and its unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, PBF GP may favor its own interests and the interests of PBFX over the interests of PBF Energy. In certain circumstances, PBF GP may refer any conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest between PBFX, on the 1 hand, and PBF Energy, on the other hand, to its conflicts committee (which must consist entirely of independent directors) for resolution, which conflicts committee must act in the best interests of the public unitholders of PBFX. As a result, PBF GP may manage the business of PBFX in a way that may differ from the best interests of PBF Energy or its stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS N1 ITEM 2 PROPERTIES
