Total production of 1,348 MBOED increased 5 percent in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase in total average production primarily resulted from new wells online in the Lower 48; an increased interest in the Western North Slope (WNS) and Greater Kuparuk Area (GKA) of Alaska following acquisitions closed in 2018; and higher production in Norway due to drilling activity and the startup of Aasta Hansteen in December 2018. The increase in production was partly offset by normal field decline and disposition impacts, primarily from the U.K. asset sale in 2019 and non core asset sales in the Lower 48 during 2018. 

Production excluding Libya was 1,305 MBOED in 2019 compared with 1,242 MBOED in 2018, an increase of 63 MBOED or 5 percent. Underlying production, which excludes Libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 MBOED in 2019 and 47 MBOED in 2018, is used to measure our ability to grow production organically. Our underlying production grew 5 percent to 1,254 MBOED in 2019 from 1,195 MBOED in 2018. 
Our worldwide annual average realized price was $48.78 per BOE in 2019, a decrease of 9 percent compared with $53.88 per BOE in 2018, reflecting weaker marker prices as a result of macroeconomic demand concerns. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price decreased 10 percent, from $68.13 per barrel in 2018 to $60.99 per barrel in 2019. Additionally, our worldwide annual average NGL prices decreased 34 percent, from $30.48 per barrel in 2018 to $20.09 per barrel in 2019. Our worldwide annual average natural gas price decreased 11 percent, from $5.65 per MCF in 2018 to $5.03 per MCF in 2019. Average annual bitumen prices increased 42 percent, from $2229 per barrel in 2018 to $3172 per barrel in 2019. 

ALASKA 
The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. We are the largest crude oil producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in 2 of North America largest oil fields located on Alaska North Slope Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a 100 percent interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are 1 of Alaska largest owners of state, federal and fee exploration leases, with approximately 132 million net undeveloped acres at year end 2019. Alaska operations contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area 
The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover NGLs before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven, Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay State fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. 

Greater Kuparuk Area 
We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include 3 central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary drilled wells and horizontal multi laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled tubing drilling. 

Western North Slope 
On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and 3 satellite fields Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a drill site which extends the Alpine reservoir west into the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR A). In 2019, we continued drilling additional wells using the available well slots on this pad. 

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPR A, was formed in 2008. In 2017, we began construction in the unit with 2 drill sites; Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT 1) and Greater Mooses Tooth #2 (GMT 2). GMT 1 achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2018 and completed drilling in 2019. We expect first oil from GMT 2 in 2021 

Alaska North Slope Gas 
In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state owned corporation, completed preliminary FEED technical work for a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska North Slope and deliver it to market.  In 2016, we, along with the affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP, indicated our intention not to progress into the next phase of the project due to changes in the economic environment. AGDC decided to continue on its own. In 2019, affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP agreed to each contribute up to $5 million or approximately 1 third of AGDC anticipated costs for full year 2020. In 2020, AGDC will be focused on permitting efforts, the most important of which is the National Environmental Protection Act process before the FERC. FERC final milest1s are the Publication of Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement, which is scheduled for March 6, 2020, and the Issuance of Final Order, which is scheduled for June 4, 2020. AGDC has recently contracted with Fluor Corporation to evaluate cost reduction opportunities in preparation for soliciting partners for the project. We continue to be willing to sell our North Slope gas to the project but do not plan to take an equity position. 

Exploration 
Appraisal of the Willow Discovery, located in the northeast portion of the NPR A, continued throughout 2019 with five appraisal wells. In 2020, we will continue appraisal of the Willow Discovery and explore the Harpoon Prospect, located southwest of Willow. 
In 2019, we drilled the West Willow 2 well to appraise the 2018 West Willow oil discovery. 
In late 2018, we commenced appraisal of the Putu Discovery with a long reach well from existing Alpine CD4 infrastructure. The CD4 appraisal well finished drilling and flow tested in 2019. A supporting injector well was drilled in late 2019 for a 2020 injectivity test. 
The Cairn 2S 315 Well was drilled in late 2018 from the 2S drill site on state leases in the Kuparuk River Unit. A long term flow test was commenced in 2019 and evaluations are ongoing. 

A 3 D seismic survey was completed in 2018 over a 250 mile area on state lands. We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities. 
We were successful in the federal lease sale on the North Slope in the fourth quarter of 2019, where we were the high bidder on 3 tracts for a total of approximately 33,000 net acres. 
Acquisitions 
In the third quarter of 2019, we completed the Nuna discovery acreage acquisition, expanding the Kuparuk River Unit by 21,000 acres and leveraging legacy infrastructure. 

Transportation 
We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an 800 mile pipeline that is part of Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company owned, double hulled tankers, and charters third party vessels as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S. 

LOWER 48 
The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico. Organized into the Gulf Coast and Great Plains business units, we hold 10.4 million net onshore and offshore acres, with a portfolio of conventional production from legacy assets as well as newer production from our low cost of supply, shorter cycle time, resource rich unconventional plays. Based on 2019 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company largest segment and contributed 39 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 22 percent of our natural gas production.

We operate 2 retention leases in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, where we own a 37.5 percent interest in the Barossa and Caldita discoveries. In April 2018, Barossa entered the FEED phase of development which continued through 2019. During the FEED phase, costs and the technical definition for the project will be finalized, gas and condensate sales agreements progressed, and access arrangements negotiated with the owners of the Darwin LNG Facility and Bayu Darwin Pipeline. In December 2019, we entered into an agreement with 3D Oil to acquire a 75 percent interest and operatorship of an offshore Tasmanian Permit located in the Otway Basin. The farm in agreement is conditional upon the agreement and signing of a JOA by both parties and required government approvals. We plan to conduct a 3D seismic survey in the second half of 2020. This activity is excluded from the dispositions discussed below. Dispositions In the second quarter of 2019, we completed the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the government of Timor Leste. In October 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our Australia West assets and operations to Santos with an expected completion date in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent. These subsidiaries hold our 37.5 percent interest in the Barossa Project and Caldita Field, our 56.9 percent interest in the Darwin LNG Facility and Bayu Undan Field, our 40 percent interest in the Greater Poseidon Fields, and our 50 percent interest in the Athena Field. Production associated with the Australia West assets to be sold was 48 MBOED in 2019. For additional information on these transactions, see Note 5 Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Ind1sia 2019 Natural Liquids Gas Total Interest Operator MBD MMCFD MBOED Average Daily Net Production South Sumatra 54 % ConocoPhillips 2 321 56 Total Ind1sia 2 321 56 During 2019, we operated 3 PSCs in Ind1sia the Corridor Block and South Jambi B, both located in South Sumatra, and Kualakurun in Central Kalimantan. Currently, we have production from the Corridor Block. South Sumatra The Corridor PSC consists of 2 oil fields and seven producing natural gas fields. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. In 2019, we were awarded a 20 year extension, with new terms, of the Corridor PSC. Under these terms, we retain a majority interest and continue as operator for at least 3 years after 2023 and retain a participating interest until 2043 Production from the South Jambi B PSC has reached depletion and field development has been suspended. This PSC expired on January 26, 2020 and has been returned to the Government of Ind1sia. Exploration We hold a 60 percent working interest in the Kualakurun PSC. After completion of prospect evaluation, we and the other joint venture partners decided to relinquish all of the remaining acreage to the Government of Ind1sia. Transportation We are a 35 percent owner of a consortium company that has a 40 percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Ind1sia, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri and Grissik to Singapore natural gas pipelines.

The Penglai 19 3 19 9 Phase 3 Project consists of 3 new wellhead platforms and a central processing platform. First oil from Phase 3 was achieved in 2018 for 2 of the platforms, with the third platform planned to come online in the second quarter of 2020. This project could include up to 186 wells, 42 of which have been completed and brought online through December 2019. In December 2018, we sancti1d the Penglai 25 6 Phase 4A Project. This project consists of 1 new wellhead platform and anticipates 62 new wells. First production is expected in 2021 Panyu Our production license for Panyu 4 2, 5 1 and 11 6 located in Block 15 34 in the South China Sea expired in September 2019. Annualized average production from these licenses were six MBOED in 2019. We still have a license for Panyu 4 1 in Block 15 34 and are evaluating this area for potential development. Exploration Exploration activities in the Bohai Penglai Field during 2019 consisted of 2 successful appraisal wells, a full field 3 D seismic program covering existing and future development opportunities, and an infill compressive seismic imaging (CSI) survey to improve imaging beneath the gas cloud in support of future development projects. In Block 15 34, 1 exploration well was drilled in the Panyu 4 1E prospect and was expensed as a dry hole. Malaysia 2019 Natural Liquids Gas Total Interest Operator MBD MMCFD MBOED Average Daily Net Production Gumusut 29.0 % Shell 23 23 Kebabangan (KBB) 30.0 KPOC 3 91 18 Malikai 35.0 Shell 15 15 Siakap North Petai 210 PTTEP 1 1 Total Malaysia 42 91 57 We have varying stages of exploration, development and production activities across 22 million net acres in Malaysia, with working interests in six PSCs. 3 of these PSCs are located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah Block G, Block J and the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC). We operated 3 exploration blocks, Block SK304, Block SK313 and Block WL4 00, off the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak. Block J Gumusut First production from the Gumusut Field occurred from an early production system in 2012 Production from a permanent, semi submersible Floating Production System was achieved in 20. We currently have a 29 percent working interest in the Gumusut Field following the redetermination of the Block J and Block K Malaysia Unit in 2017. Gumusut Phase 2 first oil was achieved in 2019. KBBC The KBBC PSC grants us a 30 percent working interest in the KBB, Kamunsu East and Kamunsu East Upthrown Canyon gas and condensate fields. KBB First production from the KBB gas field was achieved in 2014. During 2019, KBB tied in to a nearby third party floating LNG vessel which provided increased gas offtake capacity. Production in 2020 is anticipated to be impacted between 15 to 20 MBOED due to the rupture of a third party pipeline, in January 2020, which 

16 carries gas production from the KBB gas field to market. The extent of the required pipeline repairs, and the amount of time required to return this pipeline to full service is still being evaluated. Kamunsu East Development options for the Kamunsu East gas field are being evaluated. Block G Malikai We hold a 35 percent working interest in Malikai. This field achieved first production in December 2016 via the Malikai Tension Leg Platform, ramping to peak production in 2018. The KMU 1 exploration well was completed and started producing through the Malikai platform in 2018. Malikai Phase 2 development, a 6 well drilling campaign that will commence in 2020, reached a final investment decision in late 2019. Siakap North Petai We hold a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North Petai oil field. Exploration In 2016, we entered into a farm in agreement to acquire a 50 percent working interest in Block SK 313, a 14 million gross acre exploration block offshore Sarawak, with an effective date of January 2017. Following completion of the Sadok 1 exploration well in January 2017, we assumed operatorship of the block from PETRONAS and completed a 3 D seismic survey. We have no plans for further exploration activity in this block. In 2017, we were awarded operatorship and a 50 percent working interest in Block WL4 00, which included the existing Salam 1 oil discovery and encompassed 0.6 million gross acres. In 2018 and 2019, 2 exploration and 2 appraisal wells were drilled, resulting in oil discoveries under evaluation at Salam and Benum, while 2 Patawali wells were expensed as dry holes in 2019. In 2018, we were awarded a 50 percent working interest and operatorship of Block SK304 encompassing 21 million gross acres offshore Sarawak. We acquired 3 D seismic over the acreage and completed processing of this data in 2019. The Gemilang 1 exploration well in Block J was completed in late 2018. Development options are being evaluated. Qatar 2019 Natural Liquids Gas Total Interest Operator MBD MMCFD MBOED Average Daily Net Production Qatargas Operating QG3 30.0 % Company Limited 21 373 83 Total Qatar 21 373 83 QG3 is an integrated development jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips (30 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (15 percent). QG3 consists of upstream natural gas production facilities, which produce approximately 14 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas from Qatar North Field over a 25 year life, in addition to a 7.8 million gross tonnes per year LNG facility. LNG is shipped in leased LNG carriers destined for sale globally.

17 QG3 executed the development of the onshore and offshore assets as a single integrated development with Qatargas 4 (QG4), a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell plc. This included the joint development of offshore facilities situated in a common offshore block in the North Field, as well as the construction of 2 identical LNG process trains and associated gas treating facilities for both the QG3 and QG4 joint ventures. Production from the LNG trains and associated facilities is combined and shared. OTHER INTERNATIONAL The Other International segment includes exploration activities in Colombia, Chile and Argentina and contingencies associated with prior operations. Colombia We have an 80 percent operated interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM 3 The block extends over approximately 67,000 net acres and contains the Picoplata 1 Well, which completed drilling in 2015 and testing in 2017. Plug and abandonment activity started during 20 and completed in 2019. In addition, we have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM 2 Block which extends over approximately 58,000 net acres and is contiguous to the VMM 3 Block. As part of a case brought forward by environmental groups, the Highest Administrative Court granted a preliminary injunction temporarily suspending hydraulic fracturing activities until the substance of the case is decided. As a result, ConocoPhillips filed 2 separate Force Majeure requests before the competent authority for both blocks, which were granted. Chile We have a 49 percent interest in the Coiron Block located in the Magallanes Basin in southern Chile. Argentina In January 2019, we secured a 50 percent nonoperated interest in the El Turbio Este Block, within the Austral Basin in southern Argentina. In 2019, we acquired and processed 3 D seismic covering approximately 500 square miles, with evaluation of the data ongoing. In November 2019, we acquired interests in 2 nonoperated blocks in the Neuqu n Basin targeting the Vaca Muerta play. We have a 50 percent interest in the Bandurria Norte Block and a 45 percent interest in the Aguada Federal Block. In Bandurria Norte, 1 vertical and four horizontal wells were tested and shut in during 2019. In Aguada Federal, 2 horizontal wells were being tested at the end of the year. Venezuela and Ecuador For discussion of our contingencies in Venezuela and Ecuador, see Note 13 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER Marketing Activities Our Commercial organization manages our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, NGLs and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. In marketing our production, we attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit risk exposure. Commodity sales are generally made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase and sell third party volumes to better position the company to satisfy customer demand while fully utilizing transportation and storage capacity. Natural Gas Our natural gas production, along with third party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our natural gas is sold to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large industrials; independent, integrated or state owned oil and gas

18 companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market exposure and credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs. Crude Oil, Bitumen and Natural Gas Liquids Our crude oil, bitumen and NGL revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe. These commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation. LNG LNG marketing efforts are focused on equity LNG production facilities located in Australia and Qatar. LNG is primarily sold under long term contracts with prices based on market indices. Energy Partnerships Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) We are a founding member of the MWCC, a non profit organization formed in 10, which provides well containment equipment and technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC containment system meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. For additional information, see Note 3 Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP) In 2011, we, along with several leading oil and gas companies, launched the SWRP, a non profit organization based in Stavanger, Norway, which was created to enhance the industry capability to respond to international subsea well control incidents. Through collaboration with Oil Spill Response Limited, a non profit organization in the U.K., subsea well intervention equipment is available for the industry to use in the event of a subsea well incident. This complements the work being undertaken in the U.S. by MWCC and provides well capping and containment capability outside the U.S. Oil Spill Response Removal Organizations (OSROs) We maintain memberships in several OSROs across the globe as a key element of our preparedness program in addition to internal response resources. Many of the OSROs are not for profit cooperatives owned by the member companies wherein we may actively participate as a member of the board of directors, steering committee, work group or other supporting role. Globally, our primary OSRO is Oil Spill Response Ltd. based in the U.K., with facilities in several other countries and the ability to respond anywhere in the world. In North America, our primary OSROs include the Marine Spill Response Corporation for the continental United States and Alaska Clean Seas and Ship Escort Response Vessel System for the Alaska North Slope and Prince William Sound, respectively. Internationally, we maintain memberships in various regional OSROs including the Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies, Australian Marine Oil Spill Center and Petroleum Industry of Malaysia Mutual Aid Group. Technology We have several technology programs that improve our ability to develop unconventional reservoirs, produce heavy oil economically with less emissions, improve the efficiency of our exploration program, increase recoveries from our legacy fields, and implement sustainability measures. Our Optimized Cascade LNG liquefaction technology business continues to be successful with the demand for new LNG plants. The technology has been licensed for use in 26 LNG trains around the world, with feasibility studies ongoing for additional trains.  RESERVES We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2019. No difference exists between our estimated total proved reserves for year end 2018 and year end 2017, which are shown in this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2019. DELIVERY COMMITMENTS We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, including approximately 75 billion cubic feet related to the noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and 172 million barrels of crude oil in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2030. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we anticipate using PUDs and spot market purchases to fulfill any remaining commitments. See the disclosure on Proved Undeveloped Reserves in the Oil and Gas Operations section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the development of PUDs. COMPETITION We compete with private, public and state owned companies in all facets of the E&P business. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive, with no single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominating. We compete with numerous other companies in the industry, including state owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, NGLs and natural gas in an efficient, cost effective manner. Based on statistics published in the September 2, 2019, issue of the Oil and Gas Journal , we were the third largest U.S. based oil and gas company in worldwide natural gas and liquids production and worldwide liquids reserves in 2018. We deliver our production into the worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. GENERAL At the end of 2019, we held a total of 942 active patents in 50 countries worldwide, including 371 active U.S. patents. During 2019, we received 64 patents in the U.S. and 90 foreign patents. Our products and processes generated licensing revenues of $69 million related to activity in 2019. The overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession.

20 Health, Safety and Environment Our HSE organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure world class HSE performance. The framework through which we safely manage our operations, the HSE Management System Standard, emphasizes process safety, risk management, emergency preparedness and environmental performance, with an intense focus on process and occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, HSE milest1s and criteria are established annually to drive strong safety and environmental performance. Progress toward these milest1s and criteria are measured and reported. HSE audits are conducted on business functions periodically, and improvement actions are established and tracked to completion. We have designed processes relating to sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as well as social and stakeholder issues.

RISK FACTORS 
You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These risk factors are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock could be adversely affected. Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices. Prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG can fluctuate widely. Brent crude oil prices averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging from a low of $53 per barrel in January to a high of almost $75 per barrel in April. Given volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and economic environment generally, as well as increased uncertainty generated by recent (and potential future) armed hostilities in various oil producing regions around the globe, price trends may continue to be volatile. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGL and LNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock and the amount of shares we elect to acquire as part of the share repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions. Lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically, adversely affecting our proved reserves, reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields. Significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves. In the past 3 years, we recognized several impairments, which are described in Note 9 Impairments and the APLNG section of Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If commodity prices remain low relative to their historic levels, and as we continue to optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairments to long lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method and unproved properties. Although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments at this time, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result. Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations. Dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including Cash available for distribution. Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations. Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties. The level of distributions paid by comparable companies. Our operating expenses. Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends at any time, including if it determines that our net cash provided by operating activities, after deducting capital expenditures and investments, are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of dividends to our stockholders or to pay dividends to our stockholders at all.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $15 billion share repurchase program our Board of Directors had authorized. In February, 2020, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from $15 billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our Board of Directors may consider when declaring dividends, among others. Any downward revision in the amount of dividends we pay to stockholders or the number of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms. We have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital markets for funding. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Our ability to obtain additional financing, or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans, will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then outstanding debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally. We and other industry companies have had their ratings reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlooks. Any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur. Our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third parties with whom we do business. The operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries, including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. Market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly as it relates to other companies in the oil and gas industry as a result of the volatility in commodity prices. Any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances. We may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely impact our results of operations. In particular, in August 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with Petr leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) providing for the payment of approximately $2 billion over a five year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal in favor of ConocoPhillips on a contractual dispute arising from Venezuela expropriation of our interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and other pre expropriation fiscal measures. We collected approximately $0.8 billion of the $20 billion settlement in 2018 and 2019. PDVSA has defaulted on its remaining payment obligations under this agreement, we are therefore now forced to incur additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts under the agreement.  Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business. The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. If we do not conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, and our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations. Any cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result of commodity price declines may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserves. The exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry. The exploration and production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs is a highly competitive business. We compete with private, public and state owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs in an efficient, cost effective manner. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do or may be willing to incur a higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential sources of supply. If we are not successful in our competition for new reserves, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves. Our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these Item could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. For a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, see the Contingencies Environmental section of Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things Permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities.The discharge of pollutants into the environment. Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions. Carbon taxes. The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives. Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays. 24 We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. Any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions or third party litigation against us. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected. Existing and future laws, regulations and initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on GHG emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. While the U.S. announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the U.S. will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by U.S. state and local governments or by major corporations headquartered in the U.S. In addition, our operations continue in countries around the world which are party to, and have not announced an intent to withdraw from, the Paris Agreement. The implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and GHG emissions, may adversely impact the demand for our products, impose taxes on our products or operations or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emission of GHGs from our operations. As a result, we may experience declines in commodity prices or incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in pressure upon shareholders, financial institutions and or financial markets to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit investments and or funding to such companies, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, and a state government in California, New York, Washington, Rhode Island and Maryland, as well as the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen Association, Inc., filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits. The ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. In addition, although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the earth climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be adversely impacted, and demand for our products could fall. For more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company response, see the Contingencies Climate Change section of Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 25 Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through sanctions, tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the U.S. and abroad. In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on our operations; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non disclosure laws of other countries. 1 area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal and national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. EPA and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Certain jurisdictions in which we operate, including state and local governments in Colorado, have adopted or are considering regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, including subsurface water disposal. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, in 2018, Colorado voters rejected Proposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Colorado. In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by host governments, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Changes in domestic and international regulations may affect our ability to collect payments such as those pertaining to the settlement with PDVSA or the ICSID Award against the Government of Venezuela; or to obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and development of wells in various locations. Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 50 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the U.S. in 2019, and 39 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2019, were located outside the U.S. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, NGLs or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments (including the effect of international trade discussion and disputes), changing political conditions and international m1tary and currency rate fluctuations. In addition, some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system. This, coupled with changes in foreign law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations.
26 Our business may be adversely affected by price controls, government imposed limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, or the unavailability of adequate gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. As discussed above, our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL wells below actual production capacity. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us. Our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG that we produce also depends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for transport. The facilities, equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme weather events, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells, and construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment. If any facilities, equipment or diluents, or any of the transportation methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time, we may incur increased costs to transport our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for sale or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas or NGLs. Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk. We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture partners. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations al1 Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations, acquisitions or dispositions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations. We may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue. From time to time, we may seek to divest portions of our business or investments that are not important to our ongoing strategic objectives. Any dispositions we undertake may involve numerous risks and uncertainties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In particular, we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition on a timeline or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, whether due to market conditions, regulatory challenges or other concerns. In addition, the reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment returns in line with our internal or external expectations. Any dispositions we pursue may also result in disruption to other parts of our business, including through the diversion of resources and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matters, or through the disruption of relationships with our employees and key vendors. Further, in connection with any disposition, we may enter into transition services agreements or undertake indemnity or other obligations that may result in additional expenses for us. We may also be required under applicable accounting rules to recognize impairments associated with any disposition we pursue, whether or not completed. As part of our disposition strategy, on May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction included 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares. We may not be able to liquidate the shares issued to us by Cenovus Energy at prices we deem acceptable, or at all. 27 Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight. The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, armed hostilities, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil unrest or cyber attacks. Our operations may also be adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services or infrastructure required to develop, produce, process or transport our production, such as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars, tankers, barges or other infrastructure. Our operations are subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. Offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. Further, our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational comp1nts and capacity. Our technologies, systems and ne2rks may be subject to cyber attacks. Our business, like others within the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, some of which are managed by third party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. Among other activities, we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employees and third parties. As a result, we face various cyber security threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information about our operations and our employees, attempts to render our data or systems (or those of third parties with whom we do business) corrupted or unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure as well as those of third parties with whom we do business and attempted cyber terrorism. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the ne2rks and infrastructure on which they rely, many of which are not owned or operated by us, could damage critical production, distribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Although we have experienced occasional breaches of our cyber security, n1 of these breaches have had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must continually expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities detected. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent and business practices, we are unable to assure that any security measures will be effective. If our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business. While we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future. 28
