Laramie Energy has entered into certain gathering, processing and transportation contracts with third parties that require Laramie Energy to deliver fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified periods of time. Under these agreements, Laramie Energy is required to make deficiency payments for any shortfalls associated with minimum volume commitments. Laramie Energy expects to fulfill delivery commitments under gathering, processing and transportation agreements from proved developed and undeveloped reserves.

Laramie Energy The table below shows the number of development wells completed by in 2017 (the water treatment facility ). During 2018, drill times averaged 4.7 days per well, or 6.5 wells per month, and the typical pad contained 13 21 wells, depending on the well spacing being utilized on the pad. At December 31, 2018, Laramie Energy had 23 gross and net proved undeveloped locations that were drilled but not completed. Laramie Energy adjusted its development well pattern from 3 to 2 column spacing per section in 2017 to account for these improvements. This drilling pattern is intended to more efficiently develop the same sections, acreage, and reserves as were targeted in prior development plans with fewer wells per section. Our current development plan is designed to take advantage of the improved efficiencies provided by this drilling pattern as well as cost reductions provided by the January 2017 renegotiation of Laramie Energy's primary gathering and processing agreement, as well as a $17.6 million water gathering, treating, storage, and redelivery system completed by Laramie Energy is utilizing enhanced frac design to reduce the overall number of wells required to drain the same proven undeveloped acreage. As a result, Laramie Energy is currently running 1 drilling rig performing multi well pad drilling in the Mesaverde Formation. Due to the emergence and further refinement of certain technological innovations in completion techniques such as low cost proppantless fracturing, or sandless fracing, Laramie Energy Drilling Activity 35 Net undeveloped acres are reflected as if we owned our interest directly.

Laramie Energy , December 31, 2018 As of had already drilled 8 and completed 18 of the proved undeveloped locations included in the 2018 reserve report. Laramie Energy expects to expend approximately $66.8 million and $66.3 million to convert approximately 61 and 53 proved undeveloped locations to proved developed reserves in 2019 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2018, Laramie Energy had 23 proved undeveloped locations that were drilled but not yet completed. Through March 1, 2019, Laramie Energy In recognition of the potential impact of recent commodity price volatility and Par position as an equity interest owner without control of Laramie Energy operations, Par continues to base its determination of Laramie Energy proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2018 on a 2 year drilling and 3 year completion time horizon compared to the 5 year time horizon permitted under SEC requirements. Members of our reserves committee met regularly with Laramie Energy management to finalize our determination of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2018. MMcfe were mainly driven by the addition of 60,679 MMCfe of proved undeveloped reserves primarily located within Laramie Energy's northern acreage where adequate midstream capacity exists and development economics are more favorable due to Laramie Energy's elevated net revenue interests within these reserves. The additions were partially offset by 26,996 MMcfe of proved undeveloped reserves that were removed due to Laramie Energy's primary midstream provider limiting additional volumes from the area where the reserves are located. The remaining positive revisions are related to performance improvements. 37,108 Revisions of previous estimates of reserves during 2018 was substantially consistent with Laramie Energy original development plan. Of the 127 locations converted to proved developed locations in 2018, 112 were originally scheduled to be completed in 2018, and the remaining 15 were accelerated into 2018. 33 MMcfe. This activity represented 51% of the prior year end proved undeveloped reserves.

All of the natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil are produced primarily from the Mesaverde Formation and to a lesser extent the Mancos Formation and some of the acreage is contiguous. The geology of the Piceance Basin is characterized as highly consistent and predictable over large areas, which generally equates to reliable timing and cost expectations during drilling and completion activities, as well as minimal well to well variance in production and reserves when completed with the same methodology.
