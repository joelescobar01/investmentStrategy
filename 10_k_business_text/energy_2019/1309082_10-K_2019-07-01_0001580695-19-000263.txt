Item 1 Business Interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2019 decreased by $36 million or 59% when compared to the prior year primarily due to the approximate $21 million of default interest related to certain prior indebtedness which was outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2018, which was in default, and later satisfied through the foreclosure of certain of our assets, and the assignment of the IBC Bank loan in connection with the sale of a significant amount of our assets which closed in September 2018 as described above under Interest Expense. 48 Share based compensation, which is included in General and Administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations decreased approximately $0.9 million or 71% for the year ended March 31, 2019, compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in shares granted to consultants as compensation for services performed for the Company. Share based compensation is utilized for the purpose of conserving cash resources for use in field development activities and operations. Share Based Compensation. Assumption Agreement and N&B Energy Asset Disposition Agreement Recent Events Item 1 Business G&A expenses for the current period decreased by approximately $12 million or 20% primarily due to a reduction in professional fees from our financing transactions and the sale of a significant amount of our assets which closed in September 2018 as described above under ) (excluding share based compensation). G&A General and Administrative Expenses ( . Assumption Agreement and N&B Energy Asset Disposition Agreement Recent Events Item 1 Business During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a gain on sale of property and equipment of $25.8. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a loss on sale of property and equipment of ($36) million. The 825% change was due to the sale of a significant amount of our assets which closed in September 2018 as described above under Gain (Loss) on Sale of Property and Equipment. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded impairments totaling $13 million related to unproved properties due to expirations of leaseholds. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded impairments totaling $8.1 million primarily related to unproved properties due to expirations of leaseholds. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. Costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the units of production method. Amortization expense calculated per equivalent physical unit of production amounted to $4.17 and $5.74 per barrel of oil equivalent for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. DD&A decreased for the current year as compared to the prior year period by $10 million or 68% primarily related to the decrease in total depreciable assets due to the September 2018 sale. DD&A related to proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method. Under full cost accounting, the amortization base is comprised of the total capitalized costs and total future investment costs associated with all proved reserves. ).

Assumption Agreement and N&B Energy Asset Disposition Agreement Recent Events Item 1 Business In total, the overall lease operating expenses decreased $20 million or 41% for the current period, compared to the prior year period due primarily to the sale of a significant amount of our assets which closed in September 2018 as described above under Lease operating expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain Camber crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as Camber attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. The costs of services charged to Camber by vendors, fluctuate over time.

For the year ended March 31, 2018, we reported a net loss of $24.8 million, or ($287.86) per share. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the gain on the sale that closed in September 2018. ). Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each of the 2 fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2019 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Camber Energy, Inc. and notes thereto (see Results of Operations below. Results of Operations Our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and related natural gas liquids, and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our production volumes or revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. We expect prices to remain volatile for the remainder of the year. For information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues, refer to Market Conditions and Commodity Prices Other capitalized costs include title related expenses and tangible and intangible drilling costs.

The production decrease is primarily related to the effects of the September 2018 closing. Oil and Gas Revenue 45 ) rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge, which would reduce earnings. Although these hydrocarbon quantities have been determined in accordance with industry standards, they are prepared using the subjective judgments of the independent engineers, and may actually be more or less. DD&A The reserves as of March 31, 2019 were determined in accordance with standard industry practices and SEC regulations by the licensed independent petroleum engineering firm of Graves & Co. Consulting LLC. Oil, natural gas and NGL reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history, projected future production, economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, operating expenses, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and remediation costs and these estimates are inherently uncertain. If estimates of proved reserves decline, our depreciation, depletion and amortization ( ) before tax expenses for our total proved reserves was approximately $208 million. Total reserve value at March 31, 2019 represents a decrease of approximately $5.39 million or 72% from a year earlier using the same SEC pricing and reserves methodology. The decrease is primarily due to the September 2018 closing and natural declines in the production of our oil and gas properties. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are market driven and have been historically volatile, and we expect that future prices will continue to fluctuate due to supply and demand factors, seasonality, and geopolitical and economic factors, and such volatility can have a significant impact on our estimates of proved reserves and the related PV 10 value. PV 10 Using the average monthly crude oil price of $6312 per Bbl and natural gas price of $310 per Mcf for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, our estimated discounted future net cash flow ( Camber estimated total net proved and probable reserves as of March 31, 2019 were 168,620 Bbls of crude oil and NGL combined and 208,710 Mcf of natural gas which translates to an equivalent of 203,406 Boe. The total net proved reserves are 168,620 Bbls of crude oil and NGL combined and 208,710 Mcf of natural gas which translates to an equivalent of 203,406 Boe and the total net probable reserves are 0 Bbls of crude oil and NGL combined and 0 Mcf of natural gas. These reserves are based on the Oil and Gas Benchmark Prices to Estimate Year End Petroleum Reserves and Values Using U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Guidelines from the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the rights to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Reserves and economic evaluation of all of our properties are prepared on a well by well basis. The accuracy of the reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data; interpretation of that data; accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and judgement of the independent reserve engineer. Reserves For the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company produced oil, natural gas and NGLs at an average of approximately 311 Boepd from wells in 2 Texas counties and four Oklahoma counties in the Mid Continent region. The Company operates 35 gross wells as of the date of this filing. The total number of gross wells is 81, with the active producers being 36. The ratio between the gross and net production differs due to varied working interests and net revenue interests in each well. As we develop our properties, we may see the opportunity to increase our natural gas and natural gas liquids production. 44 Camber objective for our current producing wells is to operate as efficiently as possible, look for technological advancements to increase the life of the wells, evaluate the economic viability of these wells and consider adding to or working over our low producing assets. Costs associated with producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are substantial. Some of these costs vary with commodity prices, some trend with the type and volume of production, and others are a function of the number of wells we own and operate. Production expenses are the costs incurred in the operation of productive properties and workover costs. Expenses for utilities, direct labor, water transportation, injection and disposal, materials and supplies comprise the most significant portion of our production expenses. Certain Item, such as direct labor and materials and supplies, generally remain relatively fixed across broad production volume ranges, but can fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a given period. We monitor our operations to ensure that we are incurring production expenses at an acceptable level. For example, we monitor our production expenses per Boe to determine if any wells or properties should be shut in, recompleted or sold. This unit rate also allows us to monitor these costs to identify trends and to benchmark against other producers. Although we strive to reduce our production expenses, these expenses can increase or decrease on a per unit basis as a result of various factors as we operate our properties or make acquisitions and dispositions of properties. Operations With the completion of the Sale Agreement and the Assumption Agreement and the additional equity raised, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to operate as a going concern for the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. , above.

As of June 25, 2019, the Investor was still due 8,226,853 shares in connection with true ups on the conversion of the Debenture, which shares are being held in abeyance until such time, as ever, as such shares can be issued to the Investor without the Investor exceeding the 4.99% ownership limitation set forth in the Debenture. On October 31, 2018, the Investor converted the entire $495,000 of principal owed under the terms of a convertible debenture, into an aggregate of 801,507 shares of common stock, including 6,092 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the principal amount thereof (at a conversion price of $8125 per share), and 795,414 shares in connection with conversion premiums due thereon (at an initial conversion price, as calculated as provided in such debenture, of $153 per share). A total of 100,000 of such shares were issued to the Investor in connection with the initial conversion and the remaining shares were held in abeyance subject to the Investor 9.99% ownership limitation, to be issued from time to time, at the request of the Investor. Subsequent to the October 31, 2018 conversion date, the Investor was due an additional 47,645,285 shares of common stock in connection with true ups associated with the original issuance, as a result of the conversion price of the conversion premiums falling to $0.025 per share pursuant to the terms of the convertible debenture. Through March 31, 2019, a total of 11,761,418 of the conversion shares had been issued and the remainder of the shares were held in abeyance subject to the Investor 9.99% ownership limitation, to be issued from time to time, at the request of the Investor.

The debenture matures in seven years and accrues interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum. Due to the prior decline in the price of our common stock and that a trigger event occurred on June 30, 2016 as a result of the delay in filing our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended March 31, 2016, the premium rate on the debenture increased from 6% to 34% and the conversion discount became 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the measuring period (60 days prior to and 60 days after the last date that the Investor receives the last of the shares due), less $6250 per share of common stock not to exceed 85% of the lowest sales price on the last day of such period less $6250 per share.

The Company paid the dividends by way of the issuance of an aggregate of 8 shares of its common stock to the preferred stockholder pursuant to the terms of the designation (which provides that the Shares shall be based on a value of $2,187.50 per share). The beneficial owner of the Series B Preferred Stock is Alan Dreeben, the Company former director. Effective on June 17, 2019, Mr. Dreeben converted the 44,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 503 shares of common stock pursuant to a settlement agreement where the Company paid Mr. Dreeben $25,000 in consideration for agreeing to make such conversion. 42 The sales and issuances of the securities described above have been determined to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Sections 3(a)(9) and 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder and Regulation S promulgated thereunder, as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.

We do not anticipate that we will pay cash dividends or make distributions in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain and reinvest future earnings to finance operations. We may however declare and pay dividends in shares of our common stock in the future (similar to how we have in the past). Dividend Policy The Series C Preferred Stock is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation, which prevents any holder of the Series C Preferred Stock from converting such Series C Preferred Stock into common stock, if upon such conversion, the holder would beneficially own greater than 9.99% of our outstanding common stock.

Trigger events are described in the designation of the Series C Preferred Stock, but include Item which would typically be events of default under a debt security, including filing of reports late with the SEC. Measuring Period The conversion premium under the Series C Preferred Stock is payable and the dividend rate under the Series C Preferred Stock is adjustable. Specifically, the conversion rate of such premiums and dividends equals 95% of the average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the Measuring Period, not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of the Measuring Period, less $0.05 per share of common stock, unless a trigger event has occurred, in which case the conversion rate equals 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the Measuring Period, less $0.10 per share of common stock not to exceed 85% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of such the Measuring Period, less $0.10 per share.
