Item 1 and 2 Business and Properties General Gran Tierra Energy Inc., together with its subsidiaries ( Gran Tierra , the Company , us , our , or we ), is a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia and Ecuador. Our Colombian properties represented 100% of our proved reserves NAR at December 31, 2019 . For the year ended December 31, 2019 , 100% ( year ended December 31, 2018 100% , and year ended December 31, 2017 98% ) of our revenue and other income was generated in Colombia. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in June 2008 and changed our state of incorporation to the State of Delaware in October 2016. All dollar ($) amounts referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are United States (U.S.) dollars, unless otherwise indicated. 2019 Overview Acquisitions and Dispositions On February 20, 2019 , we acquired 36.2% working interest ("WI") and operatorship in the Suroriente Block and 100% WI in the Llanos 5 Block for a cash consideration of $79.1 million and a promissory note of $15 million . The acquisition increased our WI in Suroriente Block from 16% to 52% . As of December 31, 2019 , the Suroriente Block had 6,084 MBOE of proven reserves and 10,390 MBOE of proven plus probable reserves. On May 22, 2019 , we signed participation contracts for the Charapa, Chanangue and Iguana Blocks located in the Oriente Basin in Ecuador and secured 100% WI and operatorship for these blocks. We expect to commence our exploration drilling program in Ecuador during 2020. The blocks added 138,239 acres in a highly prospective basin with access to infrastructure. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we were awarded four exploration blocks (PUT 21, PUT 33, Llanos 85 and VMM 24) via successful bid rounds in Colombia. The newly awarded blocks added 286,729 acres in highly prospective basins in Colombia, all with access to infrastructure. 2019 Operational Highlights During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we incurred capital expenditures of $379.3 million , the majority of which were incurred in Colombia. In 2019 , we drilled six exploration wells, five water injectors, and 25 development wells. The six exploration wells were drilled in the PUT 1, PUT 7, El Porton, Llanos 10 and Santana Blocks. As at December 31, 2019 , 3 of these wells were producing, 2 were in progress and 1 was a dry well. We spud five water injector wells, all in the Midas Block. We spud 25 development wells; 19 in the Midas Block, 3 in the VMM 2 Block and 3 in the Chaza Block. As at December 31, 2019 , 22 of these wells were producing, 2 did not achieve economic rates and 1 was in progress. Of the seven wells in progress in Colombia as at December 31, 2018 , 3 were producing, 3 were dry and 1 remained in progress as at December 31, 2019 . During 2019, we commissi1d facilities in the Acordi1ro Field and continued other facilities work in the Moqueta and Costayaco Fields on the Chaza Block. 5 2020 Outlook Colombia remains our primary focus and represents 97% of our 2020 capital program with the remainder allocated to exploration activities in Ecuador. The table below shows break down of our 2020 capital program Number of Wells (Gross) Number of Wells (Net) 2020 Capital Budget ($ million) Colombia Development 16 19 15 18 140 160 Exploration 1 2 1 2 25 35 Ecuador Exploration 0 1 0 1 0 10 17 22 16 21 175 195 (1) (1) Assumes the mid point of budgeted amount for exploration Based on the mid point of the 2020 guidance, the capital budget is forecasted to be approximately 80% directed to development and 20% to exploration. Approximately 20% of the development activities included in the 2020 capital program are expected to be directed to facilities. We expect our 2020 capital program to be fully funded by cash flows from operations. Business Strategy Our strategy is to profitably grow our portfolio of exploration, development and production opportunities in Colombia and Ecuador in a sustainable manner. We are taking steps to grow cash flows from existing assets by developing reserves and growing reserves through enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) techniques. We have consolidated sufficient exploration opportunities to commence a 3 to five year exploration program which we expect will be fully funded through the reinvestment of cash flows from operations. 6 Oil and Gas Properties Colombia and Ecuador Acquisitions On February 20, 2019 , we acquired 36.2% WI and operatorship in the Suroriente Block and 100% WI in the Llanos 5 Block for a cash consideration of $79.1 million and a promissory note of $15 million . The acquisition increased our WI in Suroriente Block from 16% to 52% . On May 22, 2019 , we signed participation contracts for the Charapa, Chanangue and Iguana Blocks located in the Oriente Basin in Ecuador and secured 100% WI and operatorship for these blocks. We expect to commence our exploration drilling program in Ecuador during 2020. 7 During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we were awarded four exploration blocks (PUT 21, PUT 33, Llanos 85 and VMM 24) via successful bid rounds in Colombia. Excluding blocks subject to relinquishment, we have interests in 29 blocks in Colombia, 3 blocks in Ecuador and are the operator on 29 of those blocks.

Discoveries made before the enactment of Law 756 of 2002 have a royalty of 20%, and in the case of such discoveries under association contracts reverted to the national government, an additional 12% applies for a total royalty of 32%. 8 The Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbons Agency) ( ANH ) contracts have royalties that are based on a sliding scale described in Law 756 of 2002 These royalties work on an individual oil field basis starting with a base royalty rate of 8% for gross production of less than 5,000 bopd, increases in a linear fashion from 8% to 20% for gross production between 5,000 and 125,000 bopd and is stable at 20% for gross production between 125,000 and 400,000 bopd. For gross production between 400,000 and 600,000 bopd the rate increases in a linear fashion from 20% to 25%. For gross production in excess of 600,000 bopd the royalty rate is fixed at 25%. The Santana and Nancy Burdine Maxine Blocks have a fixed rate for existing production of 32% and 20%, respectively, and sliding scale for new discoveries or incremental production duly approved by ANH. In addition to the sliding scale royalty, the following blocks have additional x factor royalties Llanos 22, Putumayo 2, Putumayo 4 and Putumayo 7 1%; Sinu 1, VMM 2 and Llanos 10 3%; Putumayo 1 5%; Putumayo 31 12%; Sinu 3 17%; Putumayo 25 19%; Llanos 1, Llanos 70 31%; Llanos 53 33%. For gas fields, the royalty is on an individual gas field basis starting with a base royalty rate of 6.4% for gross production of less than 28.5 MMcf of gas per day. The royalty increases in a linear fashion from 6.4% to 16% for gross production between 28.5 MMcf of gas per day and 7125 MMcf of gas per day and is stable at 16% for gross production between 7125 to 2,280 MMcf of gas per day, and then increases in a linear fashion from 16% to 20% for gross production between 228 to 342 Bcf of gas per day. For gross production in excess of 342 Bcf of gas per day the royalty rate is fixed at 20%. An additional royalty (the HPR royalty ) applies on exploration and production contracts signed under the ANH oil regulatory regime in 2004 and onwards when cumulative gross production from an Exploitation Area is greater than five MMbbl and reference prices exceed the trigger price defined in the contract. For exploration and production contracts awarded in the 2010, 2012 and 2014 Colombia Bid Rounds, the HPR royalty will apply once the production from the area governed by the contract, rather than any particular Exploitation Area designated under the contract, exceeds five MMbbl of cumulative production. At December 31, 2019 , our production from the Costayaco and Moqueta Exploitation Areas in the Chaza block and the Acordi1ro Exploitation Area in the Midas Block were subject to the HPR royalty. The HPR royalty is calculated based on the established percent (S) of the part of the average monthly reference WTI price (P) that exceeds a base price (Po), divided by the average monthly reference price (P). In addition to these government royalties, our original interests in the Guayuyaco and Chaza Blocks acquired on our entry into Colombia in 2006 are subject to a third party royalty. The additional interests in Guayuyaco and Chaza that we acquired on the acquisition of Solana in 2008 are not subject to this third party royalty. The overriding royalty rights start with a 2% rate on working interest production less government royalties. For new commercial fields discovered within 10 years of the agreement date and after a prescribed threshold is reached, Crosby Capital, LLC ( Crosby ) reserves the right to convert the overriding royalty rights to a net profit interest ( NPI ). This NPI ranges from 7.5% to 10% of working interest production less sliding scale government royalties, as described above, and operating and overhead costs. No adjustment is made for the HPR royalty. On certain pre existing fields, Crosby does not have the right to convert its overriding royalty rights to an NPI. In addition, there are conditional overriding royalty rights that apply only to the pre existing fields. Currently, we are subject to a 10% NPI on 50% of our working interest production from the Costayaco and Moqueta Fields in the Chaza Block and 35% of our working interest production from the Juanambu Field in the Guayuyaco Block, and overriding royalties on our working interest production from the Guayuyaco Field in the Guayuyaco Block. The Putumayo 7 and Putumayo 1 Blocks are also subject to a third party royalty in addition to the government royalties. Putumayo 7 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement by which the interests in the Putumayo 7 Block were acquired, a 10% royalty on production from the Putumayo 7 Block is payable to a third party. The terms of the royalty allow for transportation costs, marketing and handling fees, government royalties (including royalties payable to the ANH pursuant to Section 39 of the contract for the Putumayo 7 Block the Rights Due to High Prices ) and taxes (other than taxes measured by the income of any party, and other than VAT or any equivalent) to be paid in cash or kind to the Government of Colombia (or any federal, state, regional or local government agency) and ANH, and a 1% 'X' factor payment to be deducted from production revenue prior to the royalty being paid to a third party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement by which the interests in the Putumayo 1 Block were acquired, a 3% royalty on production from the Putumayo 1 Block is payable to a third party. The terms of the royalty do not allow for any costs, royalties and taxes to be deducted from production revenue. Administrative Facilities Our principal executive offices are located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Calgary office lease will expire on November 29, 2022 We also have office space in Colombia and Ecuador. 9 Estimated Reserves Our 2019 reserves w ere independently prepared by McDaniel International Inc. ( McDaniel ), a wholly owned subsidiary of McDaniel & Associates. McDaniel & Associates was established in 1955 as an independent Canadian consulting firm and has been providing oil and gas reserves evaluation services to the world's petroleum industry for the past 60 years. They have internationally recognized expertise in reserves evaluations, resource assessments, geological studies, and acquisition and disposition advisory services. McDaniel's office is located in Calgary, Canada. The technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserves estimates at McDaniel meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates is the Chief Operating Officer. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Geological Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan and is a professional engineer and member of the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta. He is responsible for our engineering activities including reserves reporting, asset evaluation, reservoir management and field development. He has over 20 years of multi disciplinary upstream oil and gas experience and eight years of executive level leadership experience including leadership project management roles in international oil and gas companies. We have developed internal controls for estimating and evaluating reserves. Our internal controls over reserve estimates include 100% of our reserves are evaluated by an independent reservoir engineering firm, at least annually; and review controls are followed, including an independent internal review of assumptions used in the reserve estimates and presentation of the results of this internal review to our reserves committee. Calculations and data are reviewed at several levels of the organization to ensure consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. Our policies are applied by all staff involved in generating and reporting reserve estimates including geological, engineering and finance personnel. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors . The reserve estimation process requires us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. Therefore, the accuracy of the reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of the data, the accuracy of the assumptions based on the data and the interpretations and judgment related to the data. Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, we and the independent reserve engineers employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. Estimates of proved reserves are generated through the integration of relevant geological, engineering, and production data, utilizing technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results as defined in the SEC regulations. Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface through wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements such as seismic data. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary and commercially available seismic processing software and commercially available reservoir modeling and simulation software. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates when available. The method or combination of methods used to estimate the reserves of each reservoir was based on the unique circumstances of each reservoir and the dataset available at the time of the estimate. Probable reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves which may potentially be recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques are by nature more uncertain than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of not actually being realized by us. The probable reserves that have been assigned as of December 31, 2019 were based on both the greater percentage of recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves, as well as to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain. Possible reserves are reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. The possible reserves that have been assigned as of December 31, 2019 were based on both the greater percentage of recovery of the hydrocarbons 10 in place than assumed for probable reserves as well as to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain. The following table sets forth our estimated reserves NAR as of December 31, 2019 Oil Natural Gas Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Category (Mbbl) (MMcf) (MBOE) Proved Total proved developed reserves 36,465 1,008 36,633 Total proved undeveloped reserves 30,864 886 31,012 Total proved reserves 67,329 1,894 67,645 Probable (1) Total probable developed reserves 19,896 339 19,953 Total probable undeveloped reserves 38,259 992 38,424 Total probable reserves 58,155 1,331 58,377 Possible (1) Total possible developed reserves 21,368 460 21,445 Total possible undeveloped reserves 16,351 1,019 16,521 Total possible reserves 37,719 1,479 37,966 (1) Estimates of probable and possible reserves are more uncertain than proved reserves, but have not been adjusted for risk due to that uncertainty. Accordingly, estimates of probable and possible reserves are not comparable and have not been, or should not be, summed arithmetically with each other or with estimates of proved reserves. Product Prices Used In Reserves Estimates The product prices that were used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions and or distance from market. The average realized prices for reserves in the report are Oil ($ bbl) Colombia $ 54.05 Natural Gas ($ Mcf) Colombia $ 367 ICE Brent average of the first day of each month price for the 12 month period $ 64.20 These prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices. We do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production. Proved Undeveloped Reserves At December 31, 2019 , we had total proved undeveloped reserves NAR of 310 MMBOE ( December 31, 2018 17.3 MMBOE), which were 100% in Colombia ( December 31, 2018 100% in Colombia). Approximately 59% , 11% , 8% and 10% for a total of 88% of proved undeveloped reserves are located in our Acordi1ro, Cohembi, Costayaco and Moqueta Fields, respectively, in Colombia. N1 of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 have remained undeveloped for five years or more since initial disclosure as proved reserves and we have adopted a development plan which indicates that the proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial disclosure as proved reserves. Changes in proved undeveloped reserves during the year ended December 31, 2019 are shown in the table below 11 Colombia Oil Equivalent (MMBOE) Balance, December 31, 2018 17.3 Acquisitions 15 Converted to proved producing (8.7 ) Extensions 6.1 Technical revisions 14.8 Balance, December 31, 2019 310 In 2019 , we converted 8.7 MMBOE, or 50% , of 2018 proved undeveloped reserves to developed status. In 2019 , we made investments, consisting solely of capital expenditures, of $813 million in Colombia associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. Changes in proved undeveloped reserves during the year ended December 31, 2019 shown in the table above primarily resulted from the following significant factors Acquisitions . During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we added 15 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves as a result of acquisitions of 36.2% WI in the Suroriente Block and 20% WI in the VMM 2 Block. Converted to Proved Producing . In 2019, we converted 8.7 MMBOE, or 50% of 2018 proved undeveloped reserves to developed status. This was based on drilling 15 wells in the Midas Block, 3 wells in the Chaza Block and 2 wells in the PUT 7 Block. Extensions . Extensions added 6.1 MMBOE of 2019 proved undeveloped reserves during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were attributed to extensions of 4.9 MMBOE in the Acordi1ro field and 12 MMBOE in the Costayaco field. Technical Revisions. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we experienced revisions of 14.8 MMBOE of 2019 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily as a result of positive technical revisions based on well performance in the Acordi1ro and Cohembi Fields.

Research and Development We utilize existing technology, industry best practices and continual process improvement to execute our business plan. We have not expended any resources on pursuing research and development initiatives. Marketing and Major Customers Colombia Our oil reserves and production in Colombia are mainly located in the Middle Magdalena Valley ( MMV ) and Putumayo Basin. In MMV, our focus is on the Acordi1ro Field, where production is approximately 18 API and represented 49% of our production in 2019 . The Putumayo production (as defined below) is approximately 28 API and represented 44% of our production in 2019 . We have entered into numerous agreements to sell oil produced in the Chaza and Guayuyaco Blocks (the Putumayo production ). These agreements are subject to renegotiation for terms between 3 to twelve months and generally contain mutual termination provisions with 90 days' notice. The volume of crude oil does not include the volume of oil corresponding to royalties taken in kind, but does include volumes relating to HPR royalties. In 2019 , approximately 14% of our Putumayo production was sold to Ecopetrol and with the remainder sold to other parties. The Ecopetrol sales agreement will expire November 30, 2020. We deliver our oil to Ecopetrol through our transportation facilities which include pipelines, gathering systems and through the transportation and logistics assets of Cenit Transporte y Logistica de Hidrocarburos S.A.S ( CENIT ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ecopetrol. The point of sale of our Putumayo production to Ecopetrol is the Port of Tumaco on the Pacific coast of Colombia. In the event of pipeline disruptions, the point of sale is the Port of Esmeraldas (Ecuador) where sales are to other third parties. This route is used as a contingency. We have entered into ship and pay transportation agreements (the Transportation Agreements ) with CENIT. These agreements will expire October 31, 2020. Pursuant to the Transportation Agreements we pay a transportation tariff and transportation tax for the transportation of the Putumayo production from the Putumayo Basin to the Port of Tumaco. Pursuant to the Transportation 14 Agreements, Gran Tierra Energy Colombia Ltd. has the right to transport up to 10,000 bopd, subject to availability of capacity, (1) from Santana Station to CENIT facility at Orito through CENIT Mansoya Orito Pipeline ( OMO ), and (2) from CENIT facility at Orito to the Port of Tumaco through CENIT Orito Tumaco Pipeline ( OTA ). Generally, under these agreements, CENIT is liable (subject to specified limitations) for pollution clean up costs resulting from incidents during transportation. The cost of oil lost during transportation is shared by the parties that ship oil on the pipeline, in proportion to their share of total volumes shipped. In addition to the ship and pay transportation agreements described above, we have Capacity Transportation Agreements for 6,000 bopd, of which 3,000 bopd are under a ship or pay agreement and 3,000 bopd are under a ship and pay with initial payment agreement. These agreements will expire October 31, 2020. Putumayo production is also sold to multiple other parties, in addition to Ecopetrol. Other sales in Putumayo are generally delivered at the wellhead. Oil is delivered and sold at the Costayaco battery and Santana station for Putumayo North and at truck loading stations located in Cohembi, Quinde, Quillacinga, Nancy and Cumplidor Fields in Putumayo South. In MMV, the Acordi1ro Field production is currently sold to Ecopetrol and other third parties. We truck this volume to Impala Terminals, Barrancabermeja, Petromag, Barranquilla and Ayacucho Station, La Gloria. Production from the minor fields in MMV is sold at the wellhead on a contract which will expire June 30, 2020. In 2019 , 100% of our Llanos production was sold at wellhead. Trucking options for Llanos buyers include (1) from the Garibay Jilguero Field to facilities at Cusiana Station, a distance of approximately 77 kilometers; and (2) from the Llanos 22 Ramiriqui Field to facilities at Cusiana Station, a distance of approximately 45 kilometers. We receive revenues for our Colombian oil sales in U.S. dollars. Oil prices for sales of our crude oil are defined by agreements with the purchasers of the oil and are based generally on an average price for crude oil, referenced to ICE Brent, with adjustments for differences in quality, specified fees, transportation fees and transportation tax. Pipeline tariffs are denominated in U.S. dollars and trucking costs are in Colombian Pesos. Competition The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We face competition from both local and international companies. This competition impacts our ability to acquire properties, contract for drilling and other oil field equipment and secure trained personnel. Many competitors, such as Colombia's and Ecuador's national oil companies, have greater financial and technical resources. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. There is substantial competition for land contracts, prospects and resources in the oil and natural gas industry, and we compete to develop and produce those reserves cost effectively. In addition, we compete to m1tize our oil production for transportation capacity and infrastructure for the delivery of our products, to maintain a skilled workforce and to obtain quality services and materials. Geographic Information Based on geographic organization, Colombia is the only reportable segment. During 2019 , we signed participation contracts for 3 blocks in Ecuador. As at and for the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Ecuador business unit was not significant and was included in our Colombia reportable segment. Prior to the sale of our Brazil business unit effective June 30, 2017 and our Peru business unit effective December 18, 2017, Brazil and Peru were reportable segments. Long lived assets are Property, Plant and Equipment, which includes all oil and gas assets, furniture and fixtures, automobiles and computer equipment. No long lived assets are held in our country of domicile, which is the United States of America. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , All Other assets included assets held by our corporate head office in Calgary, Alberta, Canada which were not significant as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and were included into the Colombia reportable segment. Because all of our exploration and development operations are in Colombia and Ecuador, we face many risks associated with these operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for risks associated with our foreign operations. Regulation The oil and gas industry in both Colombia and Ecuador is heavily regulated. Rights and obligations with regard to exploration, development and production activities are explicit for each project; economics are governed by a royalty tax regime. Various government approvals are required for property acquisitions and transfers, including, but not limited to, meeting financial and 15 technical qualification criteria in order to be certified as an oil and gas company in the country. Oil and gas concessions are typically granted for fixed terms with opportunity for extension. Colombia Administration We operate in Colombia through Colombian branches of the following entities Gran Tierra Energy Colombia LLC, Gran Tierra Colombia Inc. and Gran Tierra Energy Resources Inc. Gran Tierra Energy Colombia LLC and Gran Tierra Colombia Inc. are currently qualified as operators of oil and gas properties by the ANH. In Colombia, the ANH is the administrator of the hydrocarbons in the country and therefore is responsible for regulating the Colombian oil and gas industry, including managing all exploration lands. Since 2003, Ecopetrol, the Colombian national oil company, has been a public company owned in majority by the state with the main purpose of exploring and producing hydrocarbons similar to any other oil company. In addition, Ecopetrol is a major purchaser and marketer of oil in Colombia and operates the majority of the oil transportation infrastructure in the country. The ANH uses an exploration risk contract, or the Exploration and Production Contract, which provides full risk reward benefits for the contractor. Under the terms of this contract, the successful operator retains the rights to all reserves, production and income from any new exploration block, subject to existing royalty and tax regulations. Each contract contains an exploration phase and a production phase. The exploration phase contains a number of exploration periods and each period has an associated work commitment. The production phase lasts a number of years (usually 24) from the declaration of a commercial hydrocarbon discovery. When operating under a contract, the contractor is the owner of the hydrocarbons extracted from the contract area during the performance of operations, except for royalty volumes which are collected by the ANH (or its designee). The contractor can market the hydrocarbons in any manner whatsoever, subject to a limitation in the case of natural emergencies where the law specifies the manner of sale. Ecuador Administration We operate in Ecuador through the Ecuadorian branch of Gran Tierra Energy Colombia, LLC. In Ecuador, the Ministry of Energy and Non Renewable Natural Resources ("MERNNR", for its acronym in Spanish) is the administrator of the hydrocarbons in the country and therefore is responsible for regulating the Ecuadorian oil and gas industry together with the Agency for Hydrocarbons Regulation and Control. The MERNNR uses the Participation Contract for the Exploration and or Exploitation of Hydrocarbons, which provides for full risk for the contractor and production sharing with the MERNNR. Each contract contains an exploration phase and an exploitation phase. The exploration phase has an associated work commitment and lasts typically 4 years. The exploitation phase lasts usually 20 years from the approval of the development plan for a commercial hydrocarbon discovery. When operating under a contract, the contractor is the owner of the hydrocarbons extracted from the contract area during the performance of operations, except for the share of volumes owned by the MERNNR agreed under each contract. Environmental Compliance Our activities are subject to laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control in the countries where we maintain operations. Our activities with respect to exploration, drilling, production and facilities, including the operation and construction of pipelines, plants and other facilities for transporting, processing, treating or storing oil and other products, are subject to stringent environmental regulation by regional and federal authorities in Colombia and Ecuador. Such regulations relate to environmental impact studies, the discharge of pollutants into air and water, water use and management, the management of non hazardous and hazardous waste, including its transportation, storage, and disposal, permitting for the construction of facilities, recycling requirements and reclamation standards, and the protection of certain plants and animal species as well as cultural resources and areas inhabited by indigenous peoples, among others. Risks are inherent in oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. These risks include blowouts, fires, or spills. Significant costs and liabilities may be incurred in connection with environmental compliance issues. Licenses and permits required for our exploration and production activities may not be obtainable on reasonable terms or on a timely basis, which could result in delays and have an adverse effect on our operations. Spills and releases into the environment of petroleum products can result in remediation costs and liability for damages. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, violations of environmental laws and regulations can result in the issuance 16 of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as orders or injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. In addition, indigenous groups or other local organizations could oppose our operations in their communities, potentially resulting in delays which could adversely affect our operations. Governmental or judicial actions may influence the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations and may thereby increase compliance costs. We do not expect that the cost of compliance with regional and federal provisions, which have been enacted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or natural resources, will be material to us. We have implemented a company wide web based reporting system which allows us to track incidents and respective corrective actions and associated costs. We have a Corporate Health, Safety, and Environmental Management Policy and Plan as well as a Corporate Environmental Management Plan ("EMP"). The EMP is based on the environmental performance standards of the World Bank IFC and reflects best industry practices. We have an Environmental Management System which is ISO140012015 certified representing compliance with internationally recognized industry best practice, as well as an environmental risk management program and robust waste management procedures. Air and water testing occur regularly and environmental contingency plans have been prepared for all sites and transportation of oil. We have a regular quarterly comprehensive reporting system, reporting to executive management as well as a committee of the Board of Directors. We have a schedule of internal and external audits and routine checking of practices and procedures and conduct emergency response exercises. Employees At December 31, 2019 , we had 362 full time employees ( December 31, 2018 334 ) 104 located in the Calgary corporate office, and 258 in Colombia ( 177 staff in Bogota and 81 field personnel). N1 of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Available Information We file or furnish annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). We make available free of charge through our website at www.grantierra.com our Annual Reports on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8 K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished with the SEC. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Audit Committee Charter, our Compensation Committee Charter and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter are also posted to the governance section of our website. Our website address is provided solely for informational purposes. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report or otherwise made part of this Annual Report. We intend to use our website as a means for distributing information to the public for purposes of compliance with Regulation FD. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including us. Item 1A. Risk Factors Prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate significantly, which could reduce our profitability, growth and value Substantially all of our revenues are derived from the sale of oil, the current and forward contract price which is based on world demand, supply, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, geopolitical unrest, world health events and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. Historically, the market for oil has been volatile, and for the past several years, the price of oil has been low. The market is likely to continue to be volatile in the future, and oil prices may remain at their current state or decrease further. Furthermore, prices which we receive for our oil sales, while based on international oil prices, are established by contracts with purchasers with prescribed deductions for transportation and quality differentials. These differentials can change over time and have a detrimental impact on realized prices. Future decreases in the prices of oil or sustained low prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the future results of our operations (including rendering existing projects unprofitable), financing available to us, and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis, as well as the market price for our securities. 17 Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves may be inaccurate and our actual revenues may be lower than estimated We make estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, upon which we base our financial projections and capital expenditure plans. We make these reserve estimates using various assumptions, including assumptions as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Some of these assumptions are inherently subjective, and the accuracy of our reserve estimates relies in part on the ability of our management team, engineers and other advisors to make accurate assumptions. Wells that are drilled may not achieve the results expected. Economic factors beyond our control, such as world oil prices, interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates, will also impact the quantity and value of our reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, and requires us to use significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each property. As a result, our reserves estimates are inherently imprecise. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10% or greater probability of being recovered. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, exploration and development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we estimate. Such changes could materially reduce our revenues and result in the impairment of our oil and natural gas interests. Unless we are able to replace our reserves and production, and develop and manage oil and natural gas reserves and production on an economically viable basis, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. The value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. Exploration, development and production costs (including transportation and workover costs), marketing costs (including distribution costs) and regulatory compliance costs (including taxes) will substantially impact the net revenues we derive from the oil and natural gas that we produce. These costs are subject to fluctuations and variations in the areas in which we operate, and we may not be able to predict or control these costs. If these costs exceed our expectations, this may adversely affect our results of operations. Our future reserves will depend not only on our ability to develop and effectively manage then existing properties, but also on our ability to identify and acquire additional suitable producing properties or prospects, to identify and retain responsible service providers and contractors to efficiently drill and complete our wells and to find markets for the oil and natural gas we develop and to effectively distribute our production into our markets. Exploration for oil and natural gas, and development of new formations, is risky Oil and natural gas exploration involves a high degree of operational and financial risk. These risks are more acute in the early stages of exploration, appraisal and development. It is difficult to predict the results and project the costs of implementing an exploratory drilling program due to the inherent uncertainties and costs of drilling in unknown formations and encountering various drilling conditions, such as unexpected formations or pressures, premature decline of reservoirs, the invasion of water into producing formations, tools lost in the hole, and changes in drilling plans and locations as a result of prior exploratory wells or additional seismic data and interpretations thereof. Future oil and gas exploration may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to the risks and hazards typically associated with such operations, including, but not limited to, fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, sour gas releases, spills and other environmental hazards. Such risks and hazards could result in substantial damage to oil and natural gas wells, production facilities, other property or the environment, as well as personal injury to our employees, contractors or members of the public. 18 Losses resulting from the occurrence of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although we maintain well control and liability insurance in an amount that we consider prudent and consistent with industry practice, liabilities associated with certain risks could exceed policy limits or not be covered. In either event we could incur significant costs. Our business requires significant capital expenditures, and we may not have the resources necessary to fund these expenditures Our base capital program for 2020 is $175 to $195 million for exploration and development based on a mid point range for budgeted exploration costs. This does not include the cost of any acquisitions. We expect to finance our 2020 capital program primarily through cash flows from operations. Funding this program from cash flow from operations relies in part on Brent oil prices being $60 per barrel. If cash flows from operations, cash on hand and available capacity under our credit facility are not sufficient to fund our capital program, we may be required to seek external financing or to delay or reduce our exploration and development activities, which could impact production, revenues and reserve growth. If we require additional capital, we may pursue sources of capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of projects, debt financing, equity financing or other means. We may not be able to access capital on favorable terms or at all. If we do succeed in raising additional capital, future financings may be dilutive to our shareholders, as we could issue additional shares of common stock or other equity to investors. In addition, debt and other mezzanine financing may involve a pledge of assets, require covenants that would restrict our business activities, and may be senior to interests of equity holders. We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertibles and warrants, which would adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by factors such as weak capital markets (both generally and for the oil and gas industry in particular), the location of our oil and natural gas properties in Colombia and Ecuador, low or declining prices of oil and natural gas on the commodities markets, and the loss of key management. Further, if oil or natural gas prices on the commodities markets decrease, then our revenues will likely decrease, and such decreased revenues may increase our requirements for capital. Some of the contractual arrangements governing our exploration activity may require us to commit to certain capital expenditures, and we may lose our contract rights if we do not have the required capital to fulfill these commitments. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our cash flow from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs (even to the extent that we reduce our activities), we may be required to curtail our operations. The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced by the lenders, which could prevent us from meeting our future capital needs The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently $300 million . Our borrowing base is redetermined by the lenders twice per year. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of a decline in oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. We cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base, which could deplete cash flow from operations or require additional financing. Further, our borrowing base is made available to us subject to the terms and covenants of our revolving credit facility, including compliance with the ratios and other financial covenants of such facility, and a failure to comply with such ratios or covenants could force us to repay a portion of our borrowings and suffer adverse financial impacts. Our business is subject to local legal, social, political and economic factors that are beyond our control, which could impair or delay our ability to expand our operations or operate profitably All of our reserves and production are currently located in Colombia; however, we may eventually expand to other countries. Exploration and production operations are subject to legal, social, political and economic uncertainties, including terrorism, military repression, social unrest and activism, blockades, strikes by local or national labor groups, interference with private contract rights, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, exchange controls, changes in tax rates, changes in laws or policies affecting environmental issues (including land use and water use), workplace safety, foreign investment, foreign trade, investment or taxation, as well as restrictions imposed on the oil and natural gas industry, such as restrictions on production, price 19 controls and export controls. When such disruptions occur, they may adversely impact our operations and threaten the economic viability of our projects or our ability to meet our production targets. Both Colombia and Ecuador have experienced and may in the future experience political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies, laws or regulations that might assume a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment, including but not limited to the imposition of additional taxes; nationalization; changes in energy or environmental policies or the personnel administering them; changes in oil and natural gas pricing policies; and royalty changes or increases. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign owned assets or renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions and contracts. Any changes in the oil and gas or investment regulations and policies or a shift in political attitudes in Ecuador or Colombia are beyond our control and may significantly hamper our ability to expand our operations or operate our business at a profit. We are vulnerable to risks associated with geographically concentrated operations The vast majority of our production comes from four fields. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Acordi1ro, Costayaco, Moqueta and Cohembi Fields collectively generated 83% of our production and at December 31, 2019 , these four fields accounted for 85% of our proved reserves. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of, among other things, regional supply and demand factors including limitations on our ability to most profitably sell or market our oil and natural gas to a smaller pool of potential buyers, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation, community protests, guerrilla activities, processing or transportation capacity constraints, continued authorization by the government to explore and drill in these areas, severe weather events and the availability of drilling rigs and related equipment, facilities, personnel or services. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. We rely on local infrastructure and the availability of transportation for storage and shipment of our products. This infrastructure, including storage and transportation facilities, is less developed than that in North America and may be insufficient for our needs at commercially acceptable terms in the localities in which we operate. Further, we operate in remote areas and may rely on helicopters, boats or other transportation methods. Some of these transport methods may result in increased levels of risk, including the risk of accidents involving serious injury or loss of life, and could lead to operational delays which could affect our ability to add to our reserve base or produce oil and could have a significant impact on our reputation or cash flow. Additionally, some of this equipment is specialized and may be difficult to obtain in our areas of operations, which could hamper or delay operations, and could increase the cost of those operations. Social disruptions or community disputes in our areas of operations may delay production and result in lost revenue To enjoy the support and trust of local populations and governments, we must demonstrate a commitment to providing local employment, training and business opportunities; a high level of environmental performance; open and transparent communication; and a willingness to discuss and address community issues including community development investments that are carefully selected, not unduly costly and bring lasting social and economic benefits to the community and the area. Improper management of these relationships could lead to a delay or suspension in operations, loss of license or major impact to our reputation in these communities, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot ensure that such issues or disruptions will not be experienced in the future and we cannot predict their potential impacts, which may include delays or loss of production, standby charges, stranded equipment, or damage to our facilities. We also cannot ensure that we will not experience protests or blockades erected by criminal groups or cultivators of illegal crops, in response to the Colombian government's eradication of such crops, if such crops are grown in proximity to roads required to access our operations. In addition, we must comply with legislative requirements for prior consultation of communities and ethnic groups who are affected by our proposed projects in Colombia and Ecuador. Notwithstanding our compliance with these requirements, we may be sued by such communities through a writ for protection of tutela in the Colombian courts for enhanced consultation, potentially leading to increased costs, operational delays and other impacts. In addition, several areas in Colombia have conducted Popular Consultations, essentially referendums, on extractive industries. The referendums were organized by opp1nts of the mining or oil and natural gas industries. To this point all have passed with a large majority voting to prohibit extractive industry activity in the particular region, but it remains unclear to what extent such results can impact the exercise of mineral rights conferred by the national government. We are dependent on obtaining and maintaining permits and licenses from various governmental authorities Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous licenses, permits, approvals and certificates, including environmental and other operating permits. We may not be able to obtain, sustain or renew 20 such licenses and permits on a timely basis or at all. We may also have licenses and permits rescinded or may not be able to renew expiring licenses and permits. Failure or delay in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals or permits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and explore on our properties, and receipt of drilling permits with 1rous conditions could increase our compliance costs. Loss of permits for existing drilling, water injection or other activities necessary for production may result in a decline in our production levels and revenues or damage to the well structure. Regulations and policies relating to these licenses and permits may change, be implemented in a way that we do not currently anticipate or take significantly greater time to obtain. There can be no assurance that future political conditions in Colombia and Ecuador will not result in changes to policies with respect to foreign development and ownership of oil, environmental protection, health and safety or labor relations, which may negatively affect our ability to undertake exploration and development activities in respect of present and future properties, as well as our ability to raise funds to further such activities. As we are not the operator of all the joint ventures we are currently involved in, we may rely on the operator to obtain all necessary permits and licenses. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be prevented from drilling for oil and natural gas, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability or fines. Revocation or suspension of our environmental and operating permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Security concerns in Colombia or Ecuador may disrupt our operations Oil pipelines have historically been primary targets of terrorist activity in Colombia. Although a Peace Agreement was ratified by Colombian government in 2016, the result of which was the demobilization and disarmament of the FARC guerilla group, there continue to be examples of violence against pipelines and other infrastructure that has been attributed to such guerilla groups. It is not currently known whether or to what degree violence will continue and whether and to what degree that violence may impact our operations. Notwithstanding the Peace Agreement and the continuing attempts by the Colombian government to reduce or prevent activity of guerrilla dissidents, such efforts may not be successful and such activity may continue to disrupt our operations in the future or cause us higher security costs and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Colombia and Ecuador also both have a history of security problems. Our efforts to ensure the security of our physical assets may not be successful and there can also be no assurance that we can maintain the safety of our or our contractors' field personnel and our Bogota and Quito head office personnel or operations in Colombia and Ecuador or that this violence will not adversely affect our operations in the future and cause significant loss. If these security problems disrupt our operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Environmental regulation and risks may adversely affect our business Environmental regulation is stringent and the costs and expenses of regulatory compliance are increasing. All phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to an extensive suite of international conventions and national and regional laws and regulations. Environmental legislation provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of various substances used or produced in association with oil and gas operations. The legislation also requires that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, aband1d and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties. Our operations create the risk of significant environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water or for certain other environmental impacts. There is uncertainty around the impact of environmental laws and regulations, including those presently in force and those expected to be proposed in the future. We cannot predict how future environmental laws will be interpreted, administered or enforced, but more stringent laws or regulations or more vigorous enforcement policies could in the future require material expenditures by us for the installation and operation of compliant systems; therefore it is impossible at this time to predict the nature and impact of those requirements on our company however they may have a material adverse impact on our business. Given the nature of our business, there are inherent risks of oil spills at drilling or operations sites due to operational failure, accidents, sabotage, pipeline failure or tampering or escape of oil due to the transportation of the oil by truck. All of these may lead to significant potential environmental liabilities, such as damages, litigation costs, clean up costs or penalties, some of which may be material and for which our insurance coverage maybe inadequate or unavailable. 21 All of our revenue is generated outside of Canada and the United States, and if we determine to, or are required to, repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions, we could be subject to taxes All of our revenue is generated outside of Canada and the United States. The cash generated from operations abroad is generally not available to fund domestic or head office operations unless funds are repatriated. At this time, we do not intend to repatriate further funds, other than to pay head office charges, but if we did, we might have to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions on the distribution of accumulated earnings. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested and a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. Foreign currency exchange rate volatility may affect our financial results We sell our oil and natural gas production under agreements that are denominated mainly in U.S. dollars. Many of the operational and other expenses we incur, including current and deferred tax liabilities in Colombia, are denominated in Colombian pesos. Most of our administration costs in Canada are incurred in Canadian dollars. As a result, we are exposed to translation risk when local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars, our functional currency. An appreciation of local currencies can increase our costs and negatively impact our results from operations. Because our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US$, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into US$ at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. We are also exposed to transaction risk on settlement of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency. We may be exposed to liabilities under anti bribery laws and a finding that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business We are subject to anti bribery laws in the United States, Canada, Ecuador and Colombia and will be subject to similar laws in other jurisdictions where we may operate in the future. We may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, international organizations, or private entities. As a result, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees, contractors, agents, and partners of ours or our subsidiaries or affiliates, given that these parties are not always subject to our control or direction. It is our policy to prohibit these practices. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements to those measures may prove to be less than effective or may not be followed, and our employees, contractors, agents, and partners may engage in illegal conduct for which we might be held responsible. A violation of any of these laws, even if prohibited by our policies, may result in criminal or civil sanctions or other penalties (including profit disgorgement) as well as reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If the United States imposes sanctions on Colombia or Ecuador in the future, our business may be adversely affected Colombia is among several nations whose eligibility to receive foreign aid from the United States is dependent on its progress in stemming the production and transit of illegal drugs, which is subject to an annual review by the President of the United States. Although Colombia is currently eligible for such aid, Colombia may not remain eligible in the future. A finding by the President that Colombia has failed demonstrably to meet its obligations under international counter narcotic agreements may result in the imposition of economic and trade sanctions on Colombia which could result in adverse economic consequences in Colombia including potentially threatening our ability to obtain necessary financing to develop our Colombian properties, and could further heighten the political and economic risks associated with our operations there. The threat and impact of cyberattacks may adversely impact our operations and could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and or financial loss We use digital technologies and software programs to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, as well as to process and record financial and operating data. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to store, transmit, process and record sensitive information (including trade secrets, employee information and financial and operating data), communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. The complexities of the technologies needed to explore for and develop oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information attractive to thieves. Our business processes depend on the availability, capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs and therefore it is critical to our business that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure. While we have implemented strategies to mitigate impacts from these types of events, we cannot guarantee that measures taken to defend against cybersecurity threats will be sufficient for this purpose. The ability of the information technology function to support our business in the event of a security 22 breach or a disaster such as fire or flood and our ability to recover key systems and information from unexpected interruptions cannot be fully tested and there is a risk that, if such an event actually occurs, we may not be able to address immediately the repercussions of the breach or disaster. In that event, key information and systems may be unavailable for a number of days or weeks, leading to our inability to conduct business or perform some business processes in a timely manner. Moreover, if any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Our employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate information or to introduce viruses or other malware through trojan horse programs to our computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information through email or download malware. Despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails through policies and education, spoof and phishing activities remain a serious problem that may damage our information technology infrastructure. Regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business Governments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change in some manner. GHG emissions legislation is emerging and is subject to change. For example, on an international level, in December 2015, almost 200 nations, including Colombia, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France (the Paris Agreement ), that calls for countries to set their own GHG emission targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emission targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how this legislation or any new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Current GHG emissions legislation has not resulted in material compliance costs; however, it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted, and any such future laws and regulations could result in additional compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. If we are unable to recover a significant amount of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant restrictions on GHG emissions could result in decreased demand for the oil that we produce, with a resulting decrease in the value of our reserves. Further, there have been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community to consider climate change in how they invest in companies. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk; this could negatively impact our cost of or access to capital. Increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the company's causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. Finally, although we strive to operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earth climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall. We hold a minority equity investment in PetroTal Corp. ("PetroTal"), and our inability, or limited ability, to control the operations or management of PetroTal may result in our receiving or retaining less than the amount of benefit we expect We hold a minority equity investment in PetroTal and our chief executive officer and chief financial officer serve on the board of directors of PetroTal. Even though we are able to exercise influence as a minority equity investor in PetroTal, our influence of PetroTal is limited to our rights under the share purchase agreement and its annexes and PetroTal charter and bylaws. Such limitations include a covenant by us not to exercise any voting rights associated with our shares in PetroTal which exceed 30% of the issued and outstanding common shares of PetroTal. As a result, we may be unable to implement or influence PetroTal business plan, assure quality control, or set the timing and pace of development. Our inability, or limited ability, to control the operations or management of PetroTal may result in our receiving or retaining less than the amount of benefit we might otherwise expect to receive from such investment. We may also be unable, or limited in our ability, to cause PetroTal to effect significant transactions such as large expenditures or contractual commitments, the development of properties, the construction or acquisition of assets or the borrowing of m1y. Service on the board of directors by our 2 senior executive officers will require time commitment and could expose them to liability in such role. If PetroTal or its board of directors were to experience events that exposed them to liability or reputational harm, it could have an adverse effect on us or our senior executives, including a decline in the market price of our equity securities. We may also be limited in our ability to m1tize or exit our investment in PetroTal given the limited trading market for its equity securities. 23 Shares of our Common Stock are listed on the NYSE American, the TSX and the London Stock Exchange ("LSE") and investors seeking to take advantage of price differences between such markets may create unexpected volatility in market prices Shares of our Common Stock are listed on the NYSE American, the TSX and the LSE. While the Common Stock is traded on such markets, the price and volume levels could fluctuate significantly on any market independently of the price or trading volume on other markets. Investors could seek to sell or purchase shares of Common Stock to take advantage of any price differences between the NYSE American, the TSX and the LSE through a practice referred to as arbitrage. Any arbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in the price of the Common Stock on any of these exchanges or the volume of Common Stock available for trading on any of these markets. In addition, shareholders in any of these jurisdictions will not be able to transfer such shares of Common Stock for trading on another market without effecting necessary procedures with our transfer agent or registrar. This could result in time delays and additional cost for shareholders of the Common Stock. If we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our shares of Common Stock. Our shares of Common Stock are currently listed on the NYSE, and the continued listing of our shares is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. If we fail to maintain compliance with these continued listing standards, including if the price our shares of Common Stock remains at its current low for a substantial period of time and we fail to effect a reverse stock split upon notice from the NYSE, our shares of Common Stock may be delisted. A delisting of our shares could negatively impact us by, among other things reducing the liquidity of our shares and limiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursuant strategic transactions.
