On April 17, 2019, the Company completed its initial public offering (the IPO ) of shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A common stock ). Unless indicated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to the Company (i) for periods prior to completion of the IPO, refer to the assets and operations (including reserves, production and acreage) of Brigham Resources, excluding the historical results and operations of Brigham Resources Operating, LLC ( Brigham Operating ), which was spun out in connection with the IPO, and (ii) for periods after completion of the IPO, refer to the assets and operations of Brigham Minerals and its subsidiaries, including Brigham LLC, Brigham Resources and the Minerals Subsidiaries. Overview We formed our company in 2012 to acquire and actively manage a portfolio of mineral and royalty interests in the core of what we view as the most active, highly economic, liquids rich resource basins across the continental United States. Our primary business objective is to maximize risk adjusted total return to our shareholders by both capturing growth in free cash flow from the continued development of our existing portfolio of 12,777 undeveloped horizontal drilling locations, inclusive of 715 gross permits and in addition to 892 gross DUCs, unburdened by development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, as well as leveraging our highly experienced technical evaluation team to continue to execute upon our scalable business model of sourcing, methodically evaluating and integrating accretive minerals acquisitions in the core of top tier, liquids rich resource plays. Our portfolio is comprised of mineral and royalty interests across four of the most highly economic, liquids rich resource basins in the continental United States, including the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the Denver Julesburg ( DJ ) Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. Our highly technical approach towards mineral acquisitions in the geologic core of top tier resource plays has purposefully led to a concentrated portfolio covering 39 of the most highly active counties for horizontal drilling in the continental United States. Since inception, we have executed on our technically driven, disciplined acquisition approach and have closed 1,551 transactions with third party mineral and royalty interest owners as of December 31, 2019 . We have increased our mineral and royalty interests from approximately 10,200 net royalty acres as of December 31, 2013, to approximately 82,200 net royalty acres as of December 31, 2019 , which represents a 54% compound annual growth rate in our mineral and royalty interests over that period. See Overview Our Mineral and Royalty Interests for a discussion of how we calculate net royalty acres. The following table summarizes certain information regarding our net royalty acreage acquisitions during each year of our operations. 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total Net Royalty Acres (NRAs) Acquired 500 9,700 17,300 7,200 9,800 9,400 14,900 13,400 82,200 Number of Acquisitions 15 313 380 152 121 153 201 216 1,551 Average NRAs per Acquisition 33 31 46 47 81 61 74 62 53 NRAs at Period End 500 10,200 27,500 34,700 44,500 53,900 68,800 82,200 82,200 YoY% Change 1,940 % 170 % 26 % 28 % 21 % 28 % 19 % By targeting core, top tier mineral acreage, our interests have continued to see rapid development with a total of approximately 1,104 gross horizontal wells spud on our mineral and royalty interests during the full year of 2019. This significant activity has similarly translated into rapid production growth with our production volumes growing approximately 91% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . Further, our production volumes are comprised of high value liquids with 71% of our volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 composed of 8 Table of Contents crude oil and natural gas liquids ( NGLs ), which represents 90% of our mineral and royalty revenue for the period. The combined growth in our production volumes and the high percentage of liquids production have resulted in a 64% increase in our royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . We expect to see near term organic growth in our production, revenue and free cash flow from 892 drilled but uncompleted horizontal wells ( DUCs ) across our interests and approximately 715 horizontal drilling permits as of December 31, 2019 , all of which are expected to occur without additional capital expenditure outlays. Development of permits on our acreage is driven by robust and consistent rig activity on meaningful portions of our acreage. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , there were an average of 65 horizontal rigs across our acreage, drilling approximately 2,700 net royalty acres. Likewise, over the 3 months ended December 31, 2019 , there were 60 horizontal rigs across our acreage, drilling approximately 2,500 net royalty acres. Average Quarterly Rigs on Acreage In addition to existing near term development, our permitted horizontal drilling locations represent only approximately 6% of our horizontal drilling locations, thereby providing us with a substantial long term drilling inventory on our acreage. As indicated by the following table, from 2018 to 2019 , the gross number of wells spud and wells turned to production on our acreage increased by 5% and 9% , respectively, as our average realized prices for oil, gas and NGLs decreased by 11% , 26% and 42% , respectively. Based solely on the 1,104 horizontal wells spud on our acreage during 2019 and our 12,777 total gross undeveloped horizontal drilling locations as of December 31, 2019 , we believe we have 12 years of organic drilling inventory. 2018 2019 On Our Acreage Total Across Basins Our Share of Total On Our Acreage Total Across Basins Our Share of Total Wells spud 1,049 4,885 21 % 1,104 8,599 13 % Wells turned to production 1,036 9,634 11 % 1,127 6,446 17 % Our Mineral and Royalty Interests Mineral interests are real property interests that are typically perpetual and grant both ownership of the oil, natural gas and NGLs under a tract of land and the ability to lease development rights to a third party. When those rights are leased, usually for a 3 year primary term, we typically receive an upfront cash payment, known as lease bonus, and we retain a mineral royalty, which entitles us to a percentage of production or revenue. In addition to mineral interests, which represented approximately 95% of our net royalty acres as of December 31, 2019 , we also own other types of interests, including nonparticipating royalty interests ( NPRIs ) and overriding royalty interests ( ORRIs ). ORRIs are a contractual arrangement burdening the working interest ownership of a lease and represent the right to receive a fixed percentage of production or revenue from production from a lease. ORRIs remain in effect until the associated lease expires and are therefore not perpetual in nature. As a mineral and royalty interest owner, we incur the initial cost to acquire our interests, but thereafter do not incur any development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, which are entirely borne by the operator. Mineral and royalty owners only incur their proportionate share of severance and ad valorem taxes, as well as in some instances, gathering, transportation and marketing costs. As a result, operating margins and therefore free cash flow for a mineral and royalty interest owner are higher as a percentage of revenue than for a traditional exploration and production operating company. 9 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2019 , our mineral and royalty interests consisted of approximately 57,800 net mineral acres, which have been leased to operators to explore for and develop our oil and natural gas rights at a weighted average royalty of 17.8%. Typically, within the minerals industry, mineral owners standardize ownership to a 125%, or 1 8th, royalty interest, which is referred to as a net royalty acre. Our net mineral acres standardized to a 1 8th royalty equate to approximately 82,200 net royalty acres. When standardized on a 100% royalty basis, these approximately 82,200 net royalty acres equate to approximately 10,250 100% royalty acres. Our approximately 82,200 net royalty acres are located within 1,584 drilling spacing units ( DSUs ), which are the areas designated in a spacing order or unit designation as a drilling unit and within which operators drill wellbores to develop our oil and natural gas rights. Our DSUs, in aggregate, consist of a total of approximately 1,573,950 gross acres, which we refer to as our gross DSU acreage. Within our gross DSU acreage, we expect to have an interest in wells currently producing or that will be drilled in the future. The following table summarizes our mineral and royalty interest position and the conversion of our interests between net mineral acres, net royalty acres and 100% royalty acres as of December 31, 2019 .

(3) Calculated as number of 100% royalty acres per gross DSU acre (i.e., 10,250 100% royalty acres 1,573,950 gross DSU acres). Our Properties Focus Areas Our mineral and royalty interests are primarily located in six resource plays, which we refer to as our focus areas. These include the Delaware and Midland Basins in the Permian Basin, the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin, the DJ Basin and the Williston Basin. The following chart shows our overall exposure to each of our primary focus areas based on our net royalty acres in each focus area as of December 31, 2019 . In addition, the following table summarizes certain information regarding our primary focus areas. Our average daily net production for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was comprised 56% of oil production, 29% of natural gas production and 15% of NGL production. 10 Table of Contents Acreage as of December 31, 2019 Gross Horizontal Producing Well Count as of December 31, 2019(4) Average Daily Net Production for the year ended December 31, 2019(5) (Boe d) Average Daily Net Production for the quarter ended December 31, 2019(5) (Boe d) Basin Net Mineral Acres Weighted Average Royalty Net Royalty Acres(1) 100% Royalty Acres(2) Gross DSU Acres Implied Average Net Revenue Interest per Well(3) Delaware 16,200 19.9 % 25,750 3,200 301,500 11 % 932 3,140 4,630 Midland 3,300 15.5 % 4,100 500 84,550 0.6 % 195 313 424 SCOOP 7,550 18.4 % 11,100 1,400 204,600 0.7 % 457 777 1,128 STACK 7,600 17.6 % 10,700 1,350 179,950 0.8 % 395 1,136 1,145 DJ 12,200 16.0 % 15,600 1,950 171,950 11 % 1,085 1,181 1,292 Williston 6,050 16.0 % 7,750 950 487,600 0.2 % 1,656 758 918 Other 4,900 18.4 % 7,200 900 143,800 0.6 % 188 109 90 Total 57,800 17.8 % 82,200 10,250 1,573,950 0.7 % 4,908 7,414 9,627 Note Individual amounts may not add up to totals due to rounding.

Permian Basin Delaware and Midland Basins The Permian Basin ranges from West Texas into southeastern New Mexico and is currently the most active area for horizontal drilling in the United States. The Permian Basin is further subdivided into the Delaware Basin in the west and the Midland Basin in the east. Based on our geologic and engineering data as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the Delaware Basin are prospective for seven or more producing z1s of economic horizontal development including the Wolfcamp A, B, C and XY; First, Second and Third B1 Spring; and the Avalon. Our Delaware Basin mineral and royalty interests are located in Reeves, Loving, Ward, Pecos, Culberson and Winkler Counties, Texas with our remaining interests located in Lea County, and Eddy County, New Mexico. Based on our geologic and engineering interpretations as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the Midland Basin are prospective for five or more producing z1s of economic horizontal development including the Middle Spraberry; Lower Spraberry; and Wolfcamp A, B, C, and "D" Cline. Our Midland Basin mineral and royalty interests are located in Martin, Midland, Upton, Howard, Glasscock and Reagan Counties, Texas. Anadarko Basin SCOOP and STACK Plays The SCOOP play (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) is located in central Oklahoma in Grady, Garvin, Stephens and McClain Counties. Based on our geologic and engineering interpretations as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the SCOOP play are prospective for 2 or more producing z1s of economic horizontal development including multiple Woodford benches and the Springer Shale. In addition, operators are also currently testing other formations in the area including the Sycamore, Caney and Osage, which is also referred to as SCORE (Sycamore Caney Osage Resource Expansion). The STACK play (derived from So1r Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) is located in central Oklahoma in Kingfisher, Canadian, Caddo and Blaine Counties. Based on our geologic and engineering data as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the STACK play are prospective for four or more producing z1s of economic horizontal development including multiple benches within both the Meramec and Woodford formations. DJ Basin The DJ Basin is located in Northeast Colorado and Southeast Wyoming, with the majority of operator horizontal drilling activity located in Weld and Broomfield Counties, Colorado, and Laramie County, Wyoming. Based on our geologic and engineering interpretations as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the DJ Basin are prospective for four or more producing z1s of economic horizontal development including the Niobrara A, B and C and Codell formations. Williston Basin The Williston Basin stretches from western North Dakota into eastern Montana with the majority of operator horizontal drilling activity located in Mountrail, Williams, and McKenzie Counties, North Dakota. Based on our geologic and engineering 11 Table of Contents interpretations as well as current operator delineation efforts, we believe our mineral and royalty interests are prospective for 2 or more producing z1s of economic horizontal development including the Bakken and multiple 3 Forks benches. The majority of our interests are located in Mountrail, Williams and McKenzie Counties with additional interests owned in Divide, Burke, Dunn, Billings and Stark Counties, North Dakota and Richland County, Montana. Other Counties Our other interests are comprised of mineral and royalty interests owned in Carter and Love Counties, Oklahoma in what we refer to as the Extended Woodford play in the Marietta and Ardmore Basins and in Bradford, Sullivan and Washington Counties, Pennsylvania in the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. We also own acreage in the Merge trend in Oklahoma, centered in northern Grady County and southern Canadian Counties. Our interests in Carter and Love Counties are largely being developed by Exxon Mobil Corporation through their operating subsidiary XTO Energy. Our interests in Pennsylvania are largely being developed by Range Resources Corporation and Chief Oil & Gas LLC. Prospective Undeveloped Horizontal Drilling Locations We believe our production and free cash flow will grow through the drilling of the substantial undeveloped organic inventory of horizontal drilling locations located on our acreage. As of December 31, 2019 , we have identified 12,777 gross drilling locations across our gross DSU acreage as identified in our December 31, 2019 reserve report audited by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("CG&A"), our independent petroleum engineering firm. Furthermore, we believe additional optionality is possible through the delineation of additional formations as well as incremental wells in existing formations. Approximately 51% of our total net horizontal undeveloped locations are located in the Delaware and Midland Basins, with another 22% located in the SCOOP and STACK plays of the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, as shown in the following table.

(5) A net well represents 100% net revenue interest in a single gross well. Third Party Operators Beyond our technical analysis to identify core, highly economic areas, an additional critical aspect of our evaluation process is to acquire mineral and royalty interests that will be drilled and completed by operators we believe will outperform their peers through the application of the latest drilling and completion technologies in each of our operating basins. The following chart summarizes our exposure to these operators based on the percentage of our net interests in the wells to be drilled by each operator. Net interests per gross location are normalized to 7,500 ft. laterals. 13 Table of Contents In addition, the following table shows our exposure to each of these operators broken down by our primary focus areas based on the percentage of our net interests in the wells to be drilled by each operator as of December 31, 2019 .

Our Corporate Structure Brigham Minerals, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in June 2018 for the purpose of completing the IPO and related transactions. On April 23, 2019, in connection with the IPO, Brigham Minerals became a holding company whose sole material asset consists of units in Brigham LLC (the Brigham LLC Units ). Brigham LLC wholly owns Brigham Resources, which wholly owns the Minerals Subsidiaries, which own all of our operating assets. The remainder of the Brigham LLC Units are held by affiliates of Warburg Pincus LLC ( Warburg Pincus ), Yorktown Partners LLC ( Yorktown ), Pine Brook Road Advisors, LP ( Pine Brook ) and certain of our management members and other prior investors (together with Warburg Pincus, Yorktown and Pine Brook, the Original Owners ). As the sole managing member of Brigham LLC, Brigham Minerals operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Brigham LLC, and through Brigham LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Brigham LLC and its subsidiaries and report temporary equity related to the portion of Brigham LLC Units not owned by us, which will reduce net income (loss) attributable to the holders of our Class A common stock. As of February 27, 2020 , Brigham Minerals owned 60.1% of Brigham LLC. Each of the Original Owners holds 1 share of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B common stock"), for each Brigham LLC Unit such person holds. Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holder to 1 vote on all matters to be voted on by shareholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. We do not intend to list Class B common stock on any exchange. Under the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Brigham LLC (the Brigham LLC Agreement ), each holder of a Brigham LLC Unit (a Brigham Unit Holder ) has, subject to certain limitations, the right (the Redemption Right ) to cause Brigham LLC to acquire all or a portion of its Brigham LLC Units for, at Brigham LLC election, (i) shares of our Class A common stock at a redemption ratio of 1 share of Class A common stock for each Brigham LLC Unit redeemed, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions or (ii) an equivalent amount of cash. Our decision to make a cash payment upon a Brigham Unit Holder redemption election must be made by our independent directors (within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange and Section 10A 3 of the Securities Act) who do not own LLC units that are subject to such redemption. We will determine whether to issue shares of Class A common stock or cash based on facts in existence at the time of the decision, which we expect would include the relative value of the Class A common stock (including trading prices for the Class A common stock at the time), the cash purchase price, the availability of other sources of liquidity (such as an issuance of preferred stock) to acquire the Brigham LLC Units and alternative uses for such cash. Alternatively, upon the exercise of the Redemption Right, Brigham Minerals (instead of Brigham LLC) will have the right (the Call Right ) to, for administrative convenience, acquire each tendered Brigham LLC Unit directly from the redeeming Brigham Unit Holder for, at its election, (x) 1 share of Class A common stock or (y) an equivalent amount of cash. In connection with any redemption of Brigham LLC Units pursuant to the Redemption Right or acquisition pursuant to our Call Right, the corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled. Under the Registration Rights Agreement we entered into with certain of the Original Owners in connection with the IPO, such Original Owners have the right, under certain circumstances, to cause us to register the offer and resale of their shares of Class A common stock. The following diagram indicates our simplified ownership structure as of February 27, 2020 . This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all legal entities affiliated with us. 15 Table of Contents (1) Public stockholders include shares of Class A common stock sold to the public, issued pursuant to awards granted under our LTIP or issued to Brigham Unit Holders in connection with their exercise of the Redemption Right. (2) Legacy Brigham Unit Holders include members of our management team and investors in our Company prior to our IPO (other than our Sponsors) who continue to hold Brigham LLC Units. Certain of the interests of our management in Brigham LLC are held indirectly through Brigham Equity Holdings, LLC. Brigham Equity Holdings, LLC directly owns 212,733 Brigham LLC Units, representing an approximate 0.8% interest in Brigham LLC. Total voting power does not include any shares of Class A common stock held by such legacy Brigham Unit Holders. Our Principal Stockholders We have valuable relationships with Warburg Pincus, Yorktown and Pine Brook, private investment firms focused on investments in the energy sector. As of February 27, 2020 , affiliates of Warburg Pincus, Yorktown and Pine Brook (collectively, our Sponsors ) own approximately 3,856,823 shares of Class A common stock and 18,384,074 shares of Class B common stock representing approximately 39.1% of the voting power of Brigham Minerals and 18,384,074 Brigham LLC Units. 16 Table of Contents Principal Executive Offices Our principal executive offices are located at 5914 W.

Summaries of CG&A report with respect to our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019 is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved, probable and possible reserves relating to our properties. Our internal technical team members meet with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the proved, probable and possible reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved, probable and possible reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to CG&A for our properties, such as ownership interest, oil and natural gas production, well test data, commodity prices and our estimates of our operators operating and development costs. Hal Hogsett is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. Mr. Hogsett has substantial reservoir and operations experience having worked as a petroleum engineer since 2009 and is supported by our engineering and geoscience staff. Prior to joining our Company in 2017, Mr. Hogsett worked at Apache Corporation and Antero Resources Corporation. The preparation of our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates were completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by our operators; review by Hal Hogsett, our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering, of all of our reported proved, probable and possible reserves, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new PUDs additions; verification of property ownership by our land department; review of reserve estimates by Mr. Hogsett or under his direct supervision; and direct reporting responsibilities by Mr. Hogsett to our Chief Executive Officer. 17 Table of Contents Estimation of Proved Reserves. In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term reasonable certainty means deterministically, the quantities of oil and or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not, and probabilistically, there should be at least a 90% probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate. All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves 2 distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into four broad categories or methods (i) production performance based methods; (ii) material balance based methods; (iii) volumetric based methods; and (iv) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance methods for the vast majority of properties. Certain new producing properties with very little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to similar production, both of which are considered to provide a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Non producing reserve estimates, for developed and undeveloped properties, were forecast using analogy methods. This method provides a reasonably high degree of accuracy for predicting proved developed non producing and PUDs for our properties, due to the abundance of analog data. To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, we considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data that cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. Under SEC rules, reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of 1 or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability, and include production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core data, and historical well cost and operating expense data. Estimation of Probable Reserves . Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. All of our probable reserves as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method, which involves 2 distinct determinations an estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and an estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves uses the same generally accepted analytical procedures as are used in estimating proved reserves, namely production performance based methods, material balance based methods, volumetric based methods and analogy. In the case of probable reserves, the recoverable reserves cannot be said to have a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered but are as likely as not to be recovered. The lower degree of certainty can come from several factors including (1) direct offset production that does not meet an economic threshold, despite localized averages that do meet that threshold, (2) an increased distance from offset production to the probable location of over 1 mile but under 3 miles, (3) a perceived risk of communication or depletion from nearby producers, (4) a perceived risk of attempting new drilling or completion technologies that have not been used in direct offset production or (5) an uncertainty regarding geologic positioning that could affect recoverable reserves. When considering the factors referenced above, the lower degree of certainty of our probable reserves came from a combination of these factors depending upon the applicable basin. Many of the probable locations assigned in our reserve reports had few uncertainties and resemble proved undeveloped locations except for their distance from commercial production. Other probable locations had uncertainties related to not only 18 Table of Contents distance from commercial production, but also related to well spacing and development timing. In general, we did not book probable locations if there was geologic uncertainty or if there was not commercial production to support such locations. Estimation of Possible Reserves . Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. All of our possible reserves as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method, which involves 2 distinct determinations an estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and an estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves uses the same generally accepted analytical procedures as are used in estimating proved reserves, namely production performance based methods, material balance based methods, volumetric based methods and analogy. In the case of possible reserves, the recoverable reserves cannot be said to be as likely as not to be recovered , but might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. The lower degree of certainty can come from several factors including (1) direct offset production that does not meet an economic threshold, despite localized averages that do meet that threshold, (2) an increased distance from offset production to the possible location of over 1 mile but under five miles, (3) a perceived risk of communication or depletion from nearby producers, (4) a perceived risk of attempting new drilling or completion technologies that have not been used in direct offset production or (5) an uncertainty regarding geologic positioning that could affect recoverable reserves. When considering the factors referenced above, the lower degree of certainty of our possible reserves came from a combination of these factors depending upon the applicable basin. Many of the possible locations assigned in our reserve reports had few uncertainties and resemble proved undeveloped locations except for their distance from commercial production. Other possible locations had uncertainties related to not only distance from commercial production, but also related to well spacing and development timing. In general, we did not book possible locations if there was geologic uncertainty or if there was not commercial production to support such location. Summary of Reserves. The following table presents our estimated net proved, probable and possible reserves as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , based on our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates as of such dates, which have been prepared or audited, as applicable, by CG&A, our independent petroleum engineering firm, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All of our proved, probable and possible reserves are located in the United States. 19 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2019 (1) 2018 (2) 2017 (3) Estimated proved developed reserves Oil (MBbls) 9,924 6,067 2,804 Natural gas (MMcf) 33,232 21,735 13,028 NGLs (MBbls) 2,494 1,898 1,185 Total (MBoe) 17,957 11,588 6,160 Estimated proved undeveloped reserves Oil (MBbls) 7,037 6,924 5,920 Natural gas (MMcf) 28,498 30,061 25,373 NGLs (MBbls) 3,344 3,219 2,795 Total (MBoe) 15,131 15,153 12,944 Estimated total proved reserves Oil (MBbls) 16,961 12,991 8,724 Natural gas (MMcf) 61,730 51,796 38,401 NGLs (MBbls) 5,838 5,117 3,980 Total (MBoe) 33,088 26,741 19,104 Estimated probable reserves Oil (MBbls) (4) 16,948 14,854 11,882 Natural gas (MMcf) (4) 70,627 66,682 47,659 NGLs (MBbls) (4) 8,274 7,560 5,654 Total (MBoe) (4) 36,993 33,528 25,479 Estimated possible reserves Oil (MBbls) (4) 11,986 10,302 7,426 Natural gas (MMcf) (4) 33,063 29,775 21,846 NGLs (MBbls) (4) 5,024 3,545 2,738 Total (MBoe) (4) 22,521 18,810 13,805 Oil and Natural Gas Prices Oil WTI posted price per Bbl $ 55.65 $ 65.66 $ 5134 Natural gas Henry Hub spot price per Mbtu $ 260 $ 312 $ 299 (1) Our estimated net proved, probable and possible reserves were determined using average first day of the month prices for the prior 12 months in accordance with SEC guidance.

The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. Please read Item 1A. Risk Factors. Additional information regarding our proved, probable and possible reserves can be found in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and the proved, probable and possible reserve reports as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and 2017 , which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report. PUDs As of December 31, 2019 , we estimated our PUD reserves to be 7,037 MBbls of oil, 28,498 MMcf of natural gas and 3,344 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 15,131 MBoe. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production. The following tables summarize our changes in PUDs during the year ended December 31, 2019 (in MBoe) Proved Undeveloped Reserves Balance, Dec 31, 2018 15,153 Acquisition of reserves 2,069 Extensions and discoveries 1,815 Revisions of previous estimates (2,080 ) Transfer to estimated proved developed (1,826 ) Balance, Dec 31, 2019 15,131 Changes in PUDs that occurred during 2019 were primarily due to the acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests located in the Permian, Anadarko, Williston and DJ Basins in multiple transactions, which included 2,069 MBoe of additional PUD reserves; well additions, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1,815 MBoe, as 491 horizontal well locations were converted from probable, possible and contingent resource to PUDs due to continuous activity and delineation of additional z1s on our mineral and royalty interests negative revisions of 439 MBoe attributable to a reduction in SEC pricing; reclassification of 925 MBoe to non proved due to changes in the development timing, primarily in the Anadarko Basin due to decrease in rig activity; revision of 716 MBoe attributable to 2019 NGL processing assumptions, EUR adjustments and Unit configuration; and the conversion of approximately 1,826 MBoe in PUD reserves into proved developed reserves as 346 horizontal locations were drilled and or completed As a mineral and royalty interests owner, we do not incur any capital expenditures or lease operating expenses in connection with the development of our PUDs, which costs are borne entirely by the operator. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2019 , we did not have any expenditures to convert PUDs to proved developed reserves. We identify drilling locations based on our assessment of current geologic, engineering and land data. This includes DSU formation and current well spacing information derived from state agencies and the operations of the exploration and production companies drilling our mineral and royalty interests. We generally do not have evidence of approval of our operators development plans, however, we use a deterministic approach to define and allocate locations to proved reserves. While many of our locations qualify as geologic PUDs, we limit our PUDs to the quantities of oil and gas that are reasonably certain to be recovered in the next five years. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , approximately 46% and 57% , respectively, of our total proved reserves were classified as PUDs.

Productive Wells Productive wells consist of producing horizontal wells, wells capable of production and exploratory, development or extension wells that are not dry wells. As of December 31, 2019 , we owned mineral and royalty interests in 4,908 gross productive horizontal wells, which consisted of 4,424 oil wells and 484 natural gas wells. We do not own any working interests in any wells. Accordingly, we do not own any net wells as such term is defined by Item 1208(c)(2) of Regulation S K.

In addition, we had 3,700 net royalty acres that were not leased as of December 31, 2019 . Drilling Results The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells turned to production on our properties during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the number of productive wells drilled, the quantities of reserves found and the economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return. As a mineral and royalty interest owner, we generally are not provided information as to whether any wells drilled on the properties underlying our acreage are classified as exploratory.

Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact production on our properties, including requirements to obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities; initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of aband1d wells; apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including m1tary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil, natural gas and NGL production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could increase the cost to our operators of developing our properties. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of operations on our properties, causing our operators to incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Increased costs or operating restrictions on our properties as a result of compliance with environmental laws could result in reduced exploratory and production activities on our properties and, as a result, our revenues and results of operations. The 23 Table of Contents following is a summary of certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which operations on our properties are subject. Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport, dispose of or arrange for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes generated. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA less stringent non hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil, natural gas and NGL drilling and production wastes now classified as non hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could increase the costs of our operators operations. Certain of our properties have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although the operators may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under our properties, or on or under other offsite locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. Our properties and the petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the owner or operator could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations such as restoration of pits and plugging of aband1d wells to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action. Water Discharges and NORM The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps ) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States ("WOTUS"). Following the change in U.S. Presidential Administrations, there have been several attempts to modify or eliminate this rule. Most recently, on January 23, 2020, the EPA and Corps replaced the WOTUS rule adopted in 2015 with the narrower Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and litigation is expected. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time, and any increase in scope could result in increased costs or delays with respect to obtaining permits for certain activities for our operators. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or OPA, amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into waters of the United States. OPA requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the United States. In addition, naturally occurring radioactive material ( NORM ) is brought to the surface in connection with oil and gas production. Concerns have arisen over traditional NORM disposal practices (including discharge through publicly owned treatment works into surface waters), which may increase the costs associated with management of NORM. 24 Table of Contents Air Emissions The Clean Air Act of 1963 ("CAA") and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, in June 2016 the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Separately, in December 2019, the EPA reclassified Colorado oz1 nonattainment areas under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards from moderate to serious nonattainment; as a result, also in December 2019, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission approved a set of new rules to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations in the state. These revisions could increase the costs of development and production on our properties, potentially impairing the economic development of our properties. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. Climate Change The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implementing GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities, otherwise known as Subpart OOOOa. Following the change in administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation is ongoing. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulation or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations sponsored "Paris Agreement," for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non binding, individually determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020. Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. 2 critical declarations made by 1 or more candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as, the reversal of the United Sates' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel 25 Table of Contents energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, prop1nts of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financing for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate the GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce the profitability of our interests. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas operators restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce the profitability of our interests. 1 or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Hydraulic Fracturing Activities A substantial portion of the production on our properties involved the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil, natural gas and NGLs from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids and issued permitting guidance that applies to such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued final CAA regulations in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of emissions of methane and VOCs released during hydraulic fracturing and separately published in June 2016 an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In August 2019, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 standards that, among other things, would remove sources in the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescind the methane specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the industry. As an alternative, the EPA also proposed to rescind the methane specific requirements that apply to all sources in the oil and natural gas industry, without removing the transmission and storage sources from the current source category. Legal challenges to any final rulemaking that rescinds the 2016 standards are expected. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local or regional scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. In addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. Separately, in Texas, there has been increased pressure on the Railroad Commission ( RRC ) to impose more stringent limitations on the flaring of gas from oil wells to prevent waste and because of increased concerns related to the environmental effects of flaring. The RRC continues to approve flaring permits, but at least 1 lawsuit has been filed by a pipeline operator challenging the RRC flaring approval practices. While no regulations have been proposed by the RRC to date, any future requirements limiting flaring could adversely affect exploration and production activities on our properties and result in increased costs to connect wells to pipelines. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For more information on such restrictions in Colorado, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors Implementation of new Colorado Senate Bill 19 181 may increase costs and limit oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the state, which could adversely impact future production from our properties and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations." If new federal, state or 26 Table of Contents local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect the development of our properties. Endangered Species Act The Endangered Species Act (the ESA ) restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause our operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in the affected areas. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes the Permian Basin; Lesser Prairie Chicken, which can be found in portions of the Central and Southern Great Plains; and Greater Sage Grouse, which can be found across a large swath of the northwestern United States in oil and gas producing states, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. To the extent species are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or previously unprotected species are designated as threatened or endangered in areas where our properties are located, operations on those properties could incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and face delays or limitations with respect to production activities thereon. Employee Health and Safety Operations on our properties are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right to know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Title to Properties Prior to completing an acquisition of mineral and royalty interests, we perform a title review on each tract to be acquired. Our title review is meant to confirm the quantum of mineral and royalty interest owned by a prospective seller, the property lease status and royalty amount as well as encumbrances or other related burdens. For our Texas properties, we obtain a limited title memorandum rendered by an oil and gas law firm. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. In addition to our initial title work, operators often will conduct a thorough title examination prior to leasing and or drilling a well. Should an operator title work uncover any further title defects, either we or the operator will perform curative work with respect to such defects. An operator generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until any material title defects on such property have been cured. We believe that the title to our assets is satisfactory in all material respects. Although title to these properties is in some cases subject to encumbrances, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas interests, non participating royalty interests and other burdens, easements, restrictions or minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that n1 of these encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties. Competition The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of minerals and oil and natural gas leases and personnel required to find and produce reserves. Many of our competitors not only own and acquire mineral and royalty interests but also explore for and produce oil and natural gas and, in some cases, carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. By engaging in such other activities, our competitors may be able to develop or obtain information that is superior to the information that is available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess. Our ability to acquire additional minerals and properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, oil and natural gas products compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal, and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations, and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. 27 Table of Contents Seasonality of Business Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Additionally, some of the areas in which our properties are located are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, our operators may be unable to move their equipment between locations, thereby reducing their ability to operate our wells, reducing the amount of oil and natural gas produced from the wells on our properties during such times. Additionally, extended drought conditions in the areas in which our properties are located could impact our operators ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water. Furthermore, demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth quarters. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis. Employees As of December 31, 2019 , we had 41 full time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. Legal Proceedings We are party to lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict the outcome of any such lawsuits with certainty, but management believes it is remote that pending or threatened legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in other routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities, including workers compensation claims and employment related disputes. In the opinion of our management, n1 of these other pending litigations, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, free cash flow or results of operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors The following are certain risk factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These risk factors are not exhaustive and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our business, financial condition and prospects. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, including matters addressed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our results could differ materially from expected and historical results, any of which may also adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock. Risks Related to Our Business Substantially all of our revenues are derived from royalty payments that are based on the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the acreage underlying our interests are sold. Prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are volatile due to factors beyond our control. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues, operating results, free cash flow and the carrying value of our mineral and royalty interests depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; market expectations about future prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs; the level of global oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production; 28 Table of Contents the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil, natural gas and NGLs; the price and quantity of foreign imports and U.S. exports of oil, natural gas and NGLs; the level of U.S. domestic production; political and economic conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia; the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; trading in oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts; the level of consumer product demand; weather conditions and natural disasters; technological advances affecting energy consumption, energy storage and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East and economic sanctions such as those imposed by the U.S. on oil and gas exports from Iran; global or national health concerns, including health epidemics such as the coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of 2020; the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines and other transportation facilities; the price and availability of alternative fuels; and overall domestic and global economic conditions. These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements with any certainty. For example, during the past five years, the posted price for West Texas Intermediary ( WTI ) light sweet crude oil has ranged from a low of $26.19 per barrel in February 2016 to a high of $77.41 per barrel in June 2018 , and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $149 per MMBtu in March 2016 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018 . Any substantial decline in the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs or prolonged period of low commodity prices will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. In addition, lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that can be produced economically by our operators, which may reduce our operators willingness to develop our properties. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved, probable or possible reserves, which could negatively impact our borrowing base and our ability to fund our operations. If this occurs or if production estimates change or exploration or development results deteriorate, the full cost method of accounting principles may require us to write down, as a non cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our operators could also determine during periods of low commodity prices to shut in or curtail production from wells on our properties. In addition, they could determine during periods of low commodity prices to plug and abandon marginal wells that otherwise may have been allowed to continue to produce for a longer period under conditions of higher prices. Specifically, they may abandon any well if they reasonably believe that the well can no longer produce oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially paying quantities. We depend on various unaffiliated operators for all of the exploration, development and production on the properties underlying our mineral and royalty interests. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from royalty payments made by these operators. A reduction in the expected number of wells to be drilled on our acreage by these operators or the failure of our operators to adequately and efficiently develop and operate our acreage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In particular, a number of our operators have announced a reduction in projected capital expenditures for 2020. The number of new wells drilled in certain of our focus areas has recently decreased, particularly in the STACK play in Oklahoma, and such slower development pace may continue in the future. Our assets consist of mineral and royalty interests. Because we depend on third party operators for all of the exploration, development and production on our properties, we have little to no control over the operations related to our properties. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , we received revenues from over 100 operators with approximately 61% coming from the top ten operators on our properties. The failure of our operators to adequately or efficiently perform operations or an operator failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce production and revenues. Furthermore, our operators may reduce capital 29 Table of Contents expenditures devoted to exploration, development and production on our properties, which could negatively impact revenues we receive. In particular, due in part to demand from certain investors for energy companies to exercise capital discipline by reducing capital expenditures, a number of our operators have announced a reduction in projected capital expenditures for 2020. The number of new wells drilled in certain of our focus areas has recently decreased, particularly in the STACK play in Oklahoma, and such slower development pace may continue in the future. Moreover, over the last year, many of our operators have announced that they plan to drill fewer wells per section than previously anticipated, due in part to greater well interference between parent and child wells than previously anticipated and an increased focus on overall field economics in a low commodity price environment. If production on our mineral and royalty interests decreases due to decreased development activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, limited development capital available, production related difficulties or otherwise, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Our operators are often not obligated to undertake any development activities other than those required to maintain their leases on our acreage. In the absence of a specific contractual obligation, any development and production activities will be subject to their reasonable discretion (subject to certain implied obligations to develop imposed by the laws of some states). Our operators could determine to drill and complete fewer wells on our acreage than is currently expected. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our properties, and whether the operators elect to drill any additional wells on our acreage, depends on a number of factors that are largely outside of our control, including the capital costs required for drilling activities by our operators, which could be significantly more than anticipated; the ability of our operators to access capital; prevailing commodity prices; the availability of suitable drilling equipment, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel; the operators expertise, operating efficiency and financial resources; approval of other participants in drilling wells; the operators expected return on investment in wells drilled on our acreage as compared to opportunities in other areas; the selection of technology; the selection of counterparties for the marketing and sale of production; and the rate of production of the reserves. The operators may elect not to undertake development activities, or may undertake these activities in an unanticipated fashion, which may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations and free cash flow. Sustained reductions in production by the operators on our properties may also adversely affect our results of operations and free cash flow. Additionally, if an operator were to experience financial difficulty, the operator might not be able to pay its royalty payments or continue its operations, which could have a material adverse impact on us. Our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our growth and results of operations. We depend partly on acquisitions to grow our reserves, production and free cash flow. Our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data, and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves; future oil, natural gas and NGL prices and their applicable differentials; development plans; the operating costs our operators would incur to develop and operate the properties; and potential environmental and other liabilities that operators of the properties may incur. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices, given the nature of our interests. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Even if 30 Table of Contents we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing. In addition, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently hold properties, which could subject us to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired assets into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our growth, results of operations and free cash flow. Any acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests that we complete will be subject to substantial risks. Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase our cash generated from operations, any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things the validity of our assumptions about estimated proved, probable and possible reserves, future production, prices, revenues, capital expenditures, the operating expenses and costs our operators would incur to develop the minerals; a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash generated from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions; a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions; the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate; mistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt; our ability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire; an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; and the occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges. Our operators identified potential drilling locations are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. The ability of our operators to drill and develop identified potential drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of and limitations on access to infrastructure, inclement weather, regulatory changes and approvals, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. Further, our operators identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable our operators to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present or, if present, whether oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, our operators may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If our operators drill additional wells that they identify as dry holes in current and future drilling locations, their drilling success rate may decline and materially harm their business as well as ours. We cannot assure you that the analogies our operators draw from available data from the wells on our acreage, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to their drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by our or other operators in the areas in which our reserves are located may not be indicative of future or long term production rates. Additionally, actual production from wells may be less than expected. For example, a number of operators have recently announced that newer wells drilled close in proximity to already producing wells have produced less oil and gas than forecast. Because of 31 Table of Contents these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations our operators have identified will ever be drilled or if our operators will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, the actual drilling activities of our operators may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, results of operation and free cash flow. Finally, the potential drilling locations we have identified are based on the geologic and other data available to us and our interpretation of such data. As a result, our operators may have reached different conclusions about the potential drilling locations on our properties, and our operators control the ultimate decision as to where and when a well is drilled. We may experience delays in the payment of royalties and be unable to replace operators that do not make required royalty payments, and we may not be able to terminate our leases with defaulting lessees if any of the operators on those leases declare bankruptcy. A failure on the part of the operators to make royalty payments gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of our properties, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we might not be able to find a replacement operator and, if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to a proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code ), in which case our right to enforce or terminate the lease for any defaults, including non payment, may be substantially delayed or otherwise impaired. In general, in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankrupt operator would have a substantial period of time to decide whether to ultimately reject or assume the lease, which could prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator. In the event that the operator rejected the lease, our ability to collect amounts owed would be substantially delayed, and our ultimate recovery may be only a fraction of the amount owed or nothing. In addition, if we are able to enter into a new lease with a new operator, the replacement operator may not achieve the same levels of production or sell oil or natural gas at the same price as the operator it replaced. Acquisitions and our operators development activities of our leases will require substantial capital, and we and our operators may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all. The oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with the acquisition of mineral and royalty interests. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from capital contributions, cash generated by operations, proceeds from our IPO and from the December 2019 Offering and borrowings under our debt arrangements. In the future, we may need capital in excess of the amounts we retain in our business or borrow under our revolving credit facility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access external capital on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be unable to complete acquisitions, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and free cash flow. Most of our operators are also dependent on the availability of external debt and equity financing sources to maintain their drilling programs. If those financing sources are not available to the operators on favorable terms or at all, then we expect the development of our properties to be adversely affected. If the development of our properties is adversely affected, then revenues from our mineral and royalty interests may decline. Our future success depends on replacing reserves through acquisitions and the exploration and development activities of the operators of our properties. Unless we replace the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. Producing oil and natural gas wells are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and our operators production thereof and our free cash flow are highly dependent on the successful development and exploitation of our current reserves and our ability to successfully acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Moreover, the production decline rates of our properties may be significantly higher than currently estimated if the wells on our properties do not produce as expected. We may also not be able to find, acquire or develop additional reserves to replace the current and future production of our properties at economically acceptable terms. Aside from acquisitions, we have little to no control over the exploration and development of our properties. If we are not able to replace or grow our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 32 Table of Contents We have little to no control over the timing of future drilling with respect to our mineral and royalty interests. As of December 31, 2019 , only 17,957 MBoe of our total estimated reserves were proved developed reserves. The remaining 15,131 MBoe, 36,993 MBoe and 22,521 MBoe of our total estimated reserves as of December 31, 2019 were PUDs, probable undeveloped reserves and possible undeveloped reserves, respectively, and may not ultimately be developed or produced by the operators of our properties. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations, and the decision to pursue development of an undeveloped drilling location will be made by the operator and not by us. We generally do not have access to the estimated costs of development of these reserves or the scheduled development plans of our operators. The reserve data included in the reserve report of CG&A assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop the reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of the development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop our reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves. Project areas on our properties, which are in various stages of development, may not yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities. Project areas on our properties are in various stages of development, ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that have limited drilling or production history. If the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues or if dry holes are drilled, our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow may be adversely affected. The unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies or personnel may restrict or result in increased costs for operators related to developing and operating our properties. The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly water and sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice, our operators rely on independent third party service providers to provide many of the services and equipment necessary to drill new wells. If our operators are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our operators exploration and development operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. The marketability of oil, natural gas and NGL production is dependent upon transportation, pipelines and refining facilities, which neither we nor many of our operators' control. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our or our operators ability to market our or our operators production and could harm our business. The marketability of our or our operators production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, tanker trucks and other transportation methods, and processing and refining facilities owned by third parties. The amount of oil that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of available capacity on these systems, tanker truck availability and extreme weather conditions. Also, production from our wells may be insufficient to support the construction of pipeline facilities, and the shipment of our or our operators oil, natural gas and NGLs on third party pipelines may be curtailed or delayed if it does not meet the quality specifications of the pipeline owners. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we or our operators are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or transportation, processing or refining facility capacity could reduce our or our operators ability to market the production from our properties and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. Our or our operators access to transportation options and the prices we or our operators receive can also be affected by federal and state regulation including regulation of oil, natural gas and NGL production, transportation and pipeline safety as well by general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. In addition, the third parties on whom we or our operators rely for transportation services are subject to complex federal, state, tribal and local laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business. 33 Table of Contents Our derivative activities could result in financial losses and reduce earnings. From time to time in the past we have used, and in the future we may use, derivative instruments for a portion of our future oil, natural gas and NGL production, including fixed price swaps, collars and basis swaps, to mitigate the risk and resulting impact of commodity price volatility. However, these hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows and, if entered into, are subject to the risks that the terms of the derivative instruments will be imperfect, a counterparty may not perform its obligations under a derivative contract, there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received, our hedging policies and procedures may not be properly followed and the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. Further, we may be limited in receiving the full benefit of increases in oil, natural gas and NGL prices as a result of these hedging transactions. The occurrence of any of these risks could prevent us from realizing the benefit of a derivative contract. Further, our hedging activities are not likely to mitigate the entire exposure of our operations to commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, or our hedges are not effective, our results of operations and financial position may be diminished. Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. Oil, natural gas and NGL reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved, probable and possible reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. Our estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and related valuations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were audited by CG&A and our estimates of proved, probable, and possible reserves and related valuations as of December 31, 2017 were prepared by CG&A. CG&A conducted a detailed review of all of our properties for the period covered by its reserve report using information provided by us. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. For example, in connection with the restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the 3 and six months ended June 30, 2018, we also elected to revise our previously reported reserves as of June 30, 2018 in order to properly account for our ownership interests in certain of our properties where there were title discrepancies and calculation errors within our internal reserves tracking software. In addition, certain assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves and future cash generated from operations. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered being different from our reserve estimates. Furthermore, the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with rules established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ), we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month, and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future. SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as the operators of our properties pursue their drilling programs. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if those wells are not drilled within the required five year timeframe. Furthermore, we typically do not have access to the drilling schedules of our operators and make our determinations about their estimated drilling schedules from any development provisions in the relevant lease agreement and the historical drilling activity, rig locations, production data and permit trends, as well as investor presentations and other public statements of our operators. Although we believe that our approach in making such determinations is conservative, the accuracy of any such determination is inherently uncertain and subject to a number of assumptions and factors outside of our control, 34 Table of Contents including but not limited to those described under We depend on various unaffiliated operators for all of the exploration, development and production on the properties underlying our mineral and royalty interests. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from royalty payments made by these operators. A reduction in the expected number of wells to be drilled on our acreage by these operators or the failure of our operators to adequately and efficiently develop and operate our acreage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In particular, a number of our operators have announced a reduction in projected capital expenditures for 2020. The number of new wells drilled in certain of our focus areas has recently decreased, particularly in the STACK play in Oklahoma, and such slower development pace may continue in the future. Any significant variance between our estimates and the actual drilling schedules of our operators may require us to write down our proved undeveloped reserves. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline to near or below the low levels experienced in 2015 and 2016, we could be required to record impairments of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL properties that would constitute a charge to earnings and reduce our shareholders equity. Accounting rules require that we review the carrying value of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties for possible impairment at the end of each quarter. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development activities, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. The net capitalized costs of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation for which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed estimated discounted future net revenues of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties increases during periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in 1 period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. If we incur impairment charges in the future, our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken may be materially and adversely affected. Conservation measures, technological advances and general concern about the environmental impact of the production and use of fossil fuels could materially reduce demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and adversely affect our results of operations and the trading market for shares of our Class A common stock. Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil, natural gas and NGLs, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. The impact of the changing demand for oil, natural gas and NGL services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. It is also possible that the concerns about the production and use of fossil fuels will reduce the number of investors willing to own shares of our Class A common stock, adversely affecting the market price of our Class A common stock. For example, certain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas and related infrastructure projects. Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. We rely on a few key individuals whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business. Many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of individuals. We rely on our founders for their knowledge of the oil and natural gas industry, relationships within the industry and experience in identifying, evaluating and completing acquisitions. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of 1 or more members of our executive team could disrupt our business. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive team or other key personnel. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of these key individuals. The results of exploratory drilling in shale plays will be subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. Our operators use the latest drilling and completion techniques in their operations, and these techniques come with inherent risks. When drilling horizontal wells, operators risk not landing the well bore in the desired drilling z1 and straying from the desired drilling z1 When drilling horizontally through a formation, operators risk being unable to run casing through the entire length of the well bore and being unable to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that 35 Table of Contents our operators face while completing wells include being unable to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and to clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. In addition, to the extent our operators engage in horizontal drilling, those activities may adversely affect their ability to successfully drill in identified vertical drilling locations. Furthermore, certain of the new techniques that our operators may adopt, such as infill drilling and multi well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before these wells begin producing. The results of drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently our operators will be less able to predict future drilling results in these areas. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our operators drilling results are weaker than anticipated or they are unable to execute their drilling program on our properties, our operating and financial results in these areas may be lower than we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline, and our results of operations and free cash flow could be adversely affected. Acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within 3 to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Our operators failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in the deferral of prospective drilling opportunities. In addition, our ORRIs may be lost if the underlying acreage is not drilled before the expiration of the applicable lease or if the lease otherwise terminates. Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of 3 to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. In addition, even if production or drilling is established during such primary term, if production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease typically terminates, subject to certain exceptions. Any reduction in our operators drilling programs, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the expiration of existing leases. If the lease governing any of our mineral interests expires or terminates, all mineral rights revert back to us and we will have to seek new lessees to explore and develop such mineral interests. If the lease underlying any of our ORRIs expires or terminates, our ORRIs that are derived from such lease will also terminate. Any such expirations or terminations of our leases or our ORRIs could materially and adversely affect the growth of our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. Drilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The drilling activities of the operators of our properties will be subject to many risks. For example, we will not be able to assure our shareholders that wells drilled by the operators of our properties will be productive. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGLs often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil, natural gas or NGLs to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The seismic data and other technologies used do not provide conclusive knowledge prior to drilling a well that oil, natural gas or NGL is present or that it can be produced economically. The costs of exploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our operators drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors, including unusual or unexpected geological formations; loss of drilling fluid circulation; title problems; facility or equipment malfunctions; unexpected operational events; shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and adverse weather conditions. 36 Table of Contents Any of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties. In the event that planned operations, including the drilling of development wells, are delayed or cancelled, or existing wells or development wells have lower than anticipated production due to 1 or more of the factors above or for any other reason, our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow may be materially adversely affected. Oil, natural gas and NGL operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be burdensome and expensive for our operators, and failure to comply could result in our operators incurring significant liabilities, either of which may impact our operators willingness to develop our interests. Our operators operations on the properties in which we hold interests are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may change from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include drilling operations, production and distribution activities, discharges or releases of pollutants or wastes, plugging and abandonment of wells, maintenance and decommissioning of other facilities, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs. In addition, the production, handling, storage and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the remediation, emission and disposal of oil, natural gas and NGL wastes, by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil, natural gas and NGL operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of worker health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions on our operators, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operators operations on our properties. Moreover, these laws and regulations have generally imposed increasingly strict requirements related to water use and disposal, air pollution control and waste management. Laws and regulations governing exploration and production may also affect production levels. Our operators must comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters, including, but not limited to provisions related to the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties; the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells; the spacing of wells; the plugging and abandonment of wells; and the removal of related production equipment. Additionally, federal and state regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require increased capital costs for third party oil, natural gas and NGL transporters. These transporters may attempt to pass on such costs to our operators, which in turn could affect profitability on the properties in which we own mineral and royalty interests. Our operators must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the extent the operators of our properties are shippers on interstate pipelines, they must comply with the tariffs of those pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity. Our operators may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with the governmental laws and regulations described above and may be subject to potential fines and penalties if they are found to have violated these laws and regulations. We believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue. Please read Business Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters for a description of the laws and regulations that affect our operators and that may affect us. These and other potential regulations could increase the operating costs of our operators and delay production and may ultimately impact our operators ability and willingness to develop our properties. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in our operators incurring increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays and fewer potential drilling locations. Our operators engage in hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Currently, hydraulic fracturing is generally 37 Table of Contents exempt from regulation under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ) Underground Injection Control ( UIC ) program and is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids and issued guidance covering such activities. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we own mineral or royalty interests, our operators may incur additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant and that could result in added delays or curtailment in our operators pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which would in turn reduce the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties. Moreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states in which our properties are located. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil, natural gas and NGL production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for our operators in the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult for our operators to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in our operators completion of new oil and natural gas wells on our properties and an associated decrease in the production attributable to our interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Implementation of new Colorado Senate Bill 19 181 may increase costs and limit oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the state, which could adversely impact future production from our properties and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In April 2019, Senate Bill 19 181 was signed into law in Colorado. This bill reforms the composition of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission ( COGCC ), directs the commission to impose more stringent environmental regulations with respect to permitting new oil and gas projects and also required that COGCC study the need for stricter air pollution controls for such projects. The legislation also authorizes Colorado cities and counties to take on an increased role in regulating oil and natural gas operations within their jurisdictions, including in a manner that may be more stringent than state level rules. The COGCC adopted the first rulemaking under Senate Bill 19 181, regarding flowlines, in November 2019, which requires flowlines be aband1d in whatever manner is "least impactful" in balancing a variety of risks. Hearings for rules pursuant to Senate Bill 19 181 are currently planned for the first half of 2020. Proposed regulations regarding wellbore integrity were published in December 2019, and the COGCC is expected to publish final rules sometime during the first quarter of 2020. The COGCC has also stated that it plans to promulgate regulations requiring cumulative impacts and alternative location analyses as part of applications for certain oil and gas facilities, which are expected to be proposed sometime in the first half of 2020. Some local communities have adopted additional restrictions for oil and gas activities, such as requiring greater setbacks, and other groups have sought a cessation of permit issuances entirely until the COGCC publishes new rules in keeping with SB 181 At least 1 lawsuit has been filed seeking a court order to such effect. Additionally, activist groups have submitted new ballot proposals for the 2020 election year, including proposals for increased drilling setbacks and increased bonding requirements. Any additional restrictions due to implementation of such measures could result in increased operational costs incurred by operators of our properties and limit operations, including due to delays in the state issuing new drilling permits, for exploration and production activities in Colorado, which could significantly impact future exploration and development activities on our properties. 38 Table of Contents Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our operators drilling and production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. State and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. For example, in 2015, the United States Geological Study identified eight states, including Oklahoma and Texas, with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed, most recently in Oklahoma, alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission published a new rule governing permitting or re permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal z1 or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the agency may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In some instances, regulators may also order that disposal wells be shut in. The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our operators ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from drilling and production activities by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or requiring them to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Restrictions on the ability of our operators to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. Water is an essential comp1nt of deep shale oil, natural gas and NGL production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Over the past several years, parts of the country, and in particular Texas, have experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If our operators are unable to obtain water to use in their operations from local sources, or if our operators are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, they may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. Our revolving credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and our ability to declare dividends. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility restrict, and any future financing agreements likely will restrict, our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, engage, expand or pursue our business activities or pay dividends. Our revolving credit facility restricts, and any future financing agreements likely will restrict, our ability to, among other things incur indebtedness; issue certain equity securities, including preferred equity securities; incur certain liens or permit them to exist; engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations; make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions; sell or transfer assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; pay dividends to or redeem or repurchase shares from our shareholders; make certain payments of junior indebtedness; 39 Table of Contents enter into transactions with our affiliates; enter into certain restrictive agreements; and enter into swap agreements and hedging arrangements. Our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders or to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. We also are required under our revolving credit facility to comply with, as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, (i) a ratio of total net funded debt to consolidated EBITDA not to exceed 4.00 to 100, and (ii) a current ratio of not less than 100 to 100. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of free cash flow and events or circumstances beyond our control, such as a downturn in our business or the economy in general or reduced oil, natural gas and NGL prices. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders will be inhibited and our lenders commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, the lenders can seek to foreclose on our assets. The borrowings under our revolving credit facility expose us to interest rate risk. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under the our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, the adjusted base rate or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on utilization of our revolving credit facility and ranges from (a) in the case of adjusted base rate loans, 0.750% to 1750% and (b) in the case of adjusted LIBOR rate loans, 1750% to 2750%. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts, including general short term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue other business opportunities. Our existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us; covenants in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities; our access to the capital markets may be limited; our borrowing costs may increase; we will need a substantial portion of our free cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and payment of dividends to our shareholders; and our debt level will make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and or capital expenditures, selling assets, 40 Table of Contents restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all. A series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that our operators produce. The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implementing GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities, otherwise known as Subpart OOOOa. Following the change in administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation is ongoing. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulation or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations sponsored "Paris Agreement," for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non binding, individually determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020. Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. 2 critical declarations made by 1 or more candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as, the reversal of the United Sates' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, prop1nts of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financing for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate the GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce the profitability of our interests. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas operators restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their 41 Table of Contents ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce the profitability of our interests. 1 or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Additional restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our operators ability to conduct drilling activities. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act (the ESA ) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the MBTA ). To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where our operators operate, our operators abilities to conduct or expand operations could be limited, or our operators could be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, our operators drilling activities may be delayed, restricted or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. In addition, as a result of 1 or more settlements approved by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (the FWS ), the agency was required to make a determination on the listing of numerous other species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the FWS 2017 fiscal year. The FWS did not make that deadline; however, review is reportedly ongoing. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species such as the dunes sagebrush lizard, lesser prairie chicken or greater sage grouse could cause our operators operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. The FWS and similar state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. Such a designation could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands. Operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses to us or our operators, and any losses could adversely affect our results of operations and free cash flow. The operations of our operators will be subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, NGLs and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil and NGL spills, natural gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, their operations will be subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to our operators due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations. Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our and our operators ability to succeed. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the operators of our properties compete with other companies that may have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, carry on midstream and refining operations, and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil, natural gas and NGL market prices. Our operators larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than our operators can, which would adversely affect our operators competitive position. Our operators may have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our operators industry and may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. In addition, our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transaction in a highly competitive environment. Because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects. We are not required to, and under certain circumstances we may elect not to, incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to our royalty and mineral interests. In such cases, we would rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before acquiring a specific royalty or mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render an interest worthless and can materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow. No assurance can be given that we will not suffer a m1tary 42 Table of Contents loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects in properties in which we hold an interest, we may suffer a financial loss. Loss of our or our operators information and computer systems, including as a result of cyber attacks, could materially and adversely affect our business. We and our operators rely on electronic systems and ne2rks to control and manage our respective businesses. If any of such programs or systems were to fail for any reason, including as a result of a cyber attacks, or create err1ous information in our or our operators hardware or software ne2rk infrastructure, possible consequences could be significant, including loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transaction or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Although we have multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attacks, cyber attacks on business have escalated in recent years. Moreover, our operators are becoming increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and processing activities, including interpreting seismic data, managing drilling rigs, production activities and gathering systems, conducting reservoir modeling and estimating reserves. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. If our operators become the target of cyberattacks of information security breaches, their business operations may be substantially disrupted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our efforts to monitor, mitigate and manage these evolving risks may result in increased capital and operating costs, but there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent attacks or breaches from occurring. A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business. Terrorist activities, anti terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our operators services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil, natural gas and NGL related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and, if infrastructure integral to our operators is destroyed or damaged, they may experience a significant disruption in their operations. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. A deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow. In recent years, concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and slow economic growth in the United States have contributed to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Meanwhile, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. In addition, global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, can negatively impact the global economy and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. For instance, the recent coronavirus outbreak has adversely affected our business by (i) reducing the demand for oil, NGL and natural gas because of reduced global and national economic activity, leading to lower prices for oil, NGL and natural gas, and (ii) impairing the supply chain of certain of our operators. We cannot accurately predict the duration or magnitude of the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on our business in the future. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. An oversupply of crude oil in 2015 led to a severe decline in worldwide oil prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could further diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs from our properties are sold, affect the ability of our operators to continue operations and ultimately materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow. Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock Brigham Minerals is a holding company. Brigham Minerals sole material asset is its equity interest in Brigham LLC and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Brigham LLC to pay taxes, cover its corporate and other overhead expenses and pay any dividends on our Class A common stock. Brigham Minerals is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Brigham LLC. Please see Our Corporate Structure. Brigham Minerals has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Brigham LLC has available cash, Brigham LLC is required to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to all its unitholders, including to Brigham 43 Table of Contents Minerals, in an amount generally intended to allow such holders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Brigham LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions, provided that the distribution will be sufficient to allow Brigham Minerals to satisfy its actual tax liabilities and (ii) non pro rata payments to Brigham Minerals in an amount sufficient to cover its corporate and other overhead expenses. In addition, as the sole managing member of Brigham LLC, we will cause Brigham LLC to make pro rata distributions to all of its unitholders, including to Brigham Minerals, in an amount sufficient to allow us to fund dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy, to the extent our board of directors declares such dividends. Therefore, although we have paid dividends to our stockholders in the past and expect to pay dividends on our Class A common stock in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors in the future, our ability to do so may be limited to the extent Brigham LLC and its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to make these and other distributions to us, including due to the restrictions under our revolving credit facility. To the extent that we need funds and Brigham LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost effective manner. As a public company, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NYSE, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We are required to institute a more comprehensive compliance function; comply with rules promulgated by the NYSE; continue to prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws; establish new internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading; and involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities. Furthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an emerging growth company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost effective manner. In addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. If 1 or more material weaknesses emerge related to financial reporting, or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock . Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, that we will be able to comply with 44 Table of Contents our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, or that we will not identify material weaknesses related to our financial reporting. For example, in connection with the preparation and review of our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our management identified certain material weaknesses which have since been remediated. If 1 or more material weaknesses emerge related to financial reporting in the future, or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and ability to meet our reporting obligations may be adversely affected and we may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Internal Control Procedures Material Weakness and Remediation. Our Sponsors have the ability to direct the voting of a substantial portion of the voting power of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation. As of February 27, 2020 , our Sponsors beneficially own, on a combined basis, approximately 113% of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 81% of our shares of Class B common stock, representing 39.1% of our combined economic interest and voting power. As a result, on a combined basis, our Sponsors will continue to have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our Class A common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of our Sponsors with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Given this concentrated ownership, our Sponsors would have to approve any potential acquisition of us. In addition, certain of our directors are currently employees of our Sponsors. These directors duties as employees of our Sponsors may conflict with their duties as our directors, and the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our or your best interest. Furthermore, we are party to a stockholders agreement with our Sponsors. The stockholders agreement provides each of our Sponsors with the right to designate a certain number of nominees to our board of directors so long as such Sponsor and its affiliates collectively beneficially own a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. In addition, the stockholders agreement provides our sponsors the right to approve certain material transactions so long as our Sponsors and their affiliates beneficially own specified percentages of our outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. Finally, the existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. Our Sponsors concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant stockholders. Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities. Certain of our directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations and acquisition activities, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including Warburg Pincus , Yorktown and Pine Brook affiliated entities) that are in the business of identifying and acquiring oil and natural gas properties. For example, 2 of our directors (Messrs. Holland and Levy) are senior investment professionals of Warburg Pincus, 1 of our directors (Mr. Keenan) is a Managing Member of Yorktown and 1 of our directors (Mr. St1burner) is a Managing Director of Pine Brook, all of which are in the business of investing in oil and natural gas companies with independent management teams that also seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties. In addition, Mr. Brigham, our executive chairman, is involved with certain other entities involved in the oil and gas industry, including Brigham Operating, Atlas Permian Water, Atlas Permian Sand, Brigham Development and Anthem Ventures. The existing positions held by these directors may give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. For additional discussion of our management business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest of which our stockholders should be aware, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence. 45 Table of Contents Our Sponsors and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable our Sponsors to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us. Our governing documents provide that our Sponsors and their affiliates (including portfolio investments of our Sponsors and their affiliates) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us and that we renounce any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to our Sponsors or their respective affiliates. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things permits our Sponsors and their affiliates and our directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and provides that if our Sponsors or their affiliates or any director or officer of 1 of our affiliates, our Sponsors or their affiliates who is also 1 of our directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us. Our Sponsors or their affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, our Sponsors and their affiliates may dispose of oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to our Sponsors and their affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours. Please read Description of Brigham Minerals, Inc. Class A common stock. Each of our Sponsors is an established participant in the oil and natural gas industry and has resources greater than ours, which may make it more difficult for us to compete with our Sponsors with respect to commercial activities as well as for potential acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any conflicts that may arise between us and our stockholders, on the 1 hand, and our Sponsors, on the other hand, will be resolved in our favor. As a result, competition from our Sponsors and their affiliates could adversely impact our results of operations. A significant reduction by our Sponsors of their ownership interests in us could adversely affect us. We believe that our Sponsor ownership interests in us provide them with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. However, our Sponsors are not subject to any obligation to maintain their ownership interest in us and may elect at any time thereafter to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce their ownership interest in us. If our Sponsors sell all or a substantial portion of their respective ownership interests in us, they may have less incentive to assist in our success and their affiliate(s) that are expected to serve as members of our board of directors may resign. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval in 1 or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders; 46 Table of Contents provide that the authorized number of directors constituting our board of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, the terms of the stockholders agreement or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of our preferred stock, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; provide that our bylaws can be amended by the board of directors; provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of our preferred stock with respect to such series; provide that our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66 2 3% of our then outstanding shares of common stock; provide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the board of directors serving at the time of such vote; provide for our board of directors to be divided into 3 classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered 3 year terms, other than directors that may be elected by holders of our preferred stock, if any; provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66 2 3% in voting power of all then outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to remove any or all of the directors from office, and such removal may only be for cause ; and prohibit cumulative voting on all matters. Furthermore, the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, 1 or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited by our holding company structure, contractual restrictions and regulatory requirements. Brigham Minerals is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Brigham LLC Units, and Brigham Minerals does not have any independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Brigham LLC has available cash, Brigham LLC is required to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to all its unitholders, including to Brigham Minerals, in an amount generally intended to allow such holders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Brigham LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions, provided that the distribution will be sufficient to allow Brigham Minerals to satisfy its actual tax liabilities and (ii) non pro rata payments to Brigham Minerals in an amount 47 Table of Contents sufficient to cover its corporate and other overhead expenses. In addition, as the sole managing member of Brigham LLC, Brigham Minerals will cause Brigham LLC to make pro rata distributions to all of its unitholders, including to Brigham Minerals, in an amount sufficient to allow it to fund dividends to its stockholders in accordance with its dividend policy, to the extent its board of directors declares such dividends. Brigham LLC is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit Brigham Minerals ability to obtain cash from it. If Brigham LLC is unable to make distributions, we may not receive adequate distributions, which could materially and adversely affect our free cash flow and financial position and our ability to fund any dividends. Although we have paid dividends on our Class A common stock and expect to pay dividends on our Class A common stock in the future, our board of directors will take into account general economic and business conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including restrictions and covenants contained in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant in determining whether, and in what amounts, to pay such dividends. In addition, our revolving credit facility limits the amount of distributions that Brigham LLC can make to us and the purposes for which distributions could be made. Accordingly, we may not be able to pay dividends even if our board of directors would otherwise deem it appropriate. See Dividend Policy, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity and Description of Brigham Minerals, Inc. Class A common stock. In certain circumstances, Brigham LLC will be required to make tax distributions to the Brigham Unit Holders, including Brigham Minerals, and such tax distributions may be substantial. To the extent Brigham Minerals receives tax distributions in excess of its actual tax liabilities and retains such excess cash, the Original Owners would benefit from such accumulated cash balances if they exercise their Redemption Right. Pursuant to the Brigham LLC Agreement, to the extent Brigham LLC has available cash (taking into account existing and projected capital expenditures), Brigham LLC is required to make generally pro rata distributions (which we refer to as tax distributions ), to all its unitholders, including Brigham Minerals, in an amount generally intended to allow the Brigham Unit Holders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Brigham LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions, provided that tax distributions will be made sufficient to allow Brigham Minerals to satisfy its actual tax liabilities. The amount of such tax distributions will be determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumed individual income tax rate, and will be calculated after taking into account other distributions (including other tax distributions) made by Brigham LLC. Because tax distributions will be made pro rata based on ownership and due to, among other Item, differences between the tax rates applicable to Brigham Minerals and the assumed individual income tax rate used in the calculation and requirements under the applicable tax rules that Brigham LLC net taxable income be allocated disproportionately to its unitholders in certain circumstances, tax distributions may significantly exceed the actual tax liability for many of the Brigham Unit Holders, including Brigham Minerals. If Brigham Minerals retains the excess cash it receives, the Original Owners would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances upon their exercise of the Redemption Right. However, we expect to use such accumulated cash balances to pay dividends in respect of our Class A common stock or to take other steps to eliminate any material cash balances. In addition, the tax distributions Brigham LLC will be required to make may be substantial and may exceed the tax liabilities that would be owed by a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. Funds used by Brigham LLC to satisfy its tax distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business, except to the extent Brigham Minerals uses the excess cash it receives to reinvest in Brigham LLC for additional units. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of distributions on our Class A common stock to a holder will depend upon our tax attributes and the holder tax basis in our stock, which are not necessarily predictable and can change over time. Distributions of cash or property on our Class A common stock, if any, will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of the non U.S. holder tax basis in our Class A common stock and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock. Also, if any holder sells our Class A common stock, the holder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the holder tax basis in such Class A common stock. To the extent that the amount of our distributions is treated as a non taxable return of capital as described above, such distribution will reduce a holder tax basis in the Class A common stock. Consequently, such excess distributions will result in a corresponding increase in the amount of gain, or a corresponding decrease in the amount of loss, recognized by the holder upon the sale of the Class A common stock or subsequent distributions with respect to such stock. Additionally, with regard to U.S. corporate holders of our Class A shares, to the extent that a distribution on our Class A shares exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and such holder tax basis in such shares, such holders would be unable to utilize the corporate 48 Table of Contents dividends received deduction (to the extent it would otherwise be applicable to such holder) with respect to the gain resulting from such excess distribution. Investors in our Class A common stock are encouraged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of receiving distributions on our Class A shares that are not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Future sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us. Certain of our Original Owners own shares of our Class A common stock and, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Original Owners that hold Brigham LLC Units may require Brigham LLC to redeem their Brigham LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock (on a 1 for 1 basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions), and our Original Owners may sell any of such shares of Class A common stock. As of February 27, 2020 , we had outstanding 34,181,268 shares of Class A common stock and 22,706,711 shares of Class B common stock, representing approximately 39.9% of our total outstanding shares. In addition, our Sponsors continue to hold 3,856,823 shares of our Class A common stock, representing approximately 113% of our total shares of Class A common stock outstanding. The Sponsors are party to a registration rights agreement, which requires us to effect the registration of their shares in certain circumstances. See Our Corporate Structure and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. We have previously filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S 8 providing for the registration of 5,999,600 shares of our Class A common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S 8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. Our organizational structure confers certain benefits upon the Original Owners that will not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it will benefit the Original Owners. Our organizational structure confers certain benefits upon the Original Owners that do not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it will benefit the Original Owners. Brigham Minerals is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Brigham LLC Units. As a consequence, our ability to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock is subject to the ability of Brigham LLC to provide distributions to us. If Brigham LLC makes such distributions, the Original Owners will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions from Brigham LLC on a pro rata basis. However, because we must pay taxes, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of our Class A common stock are expected to be less on a per share basis than the amounts distributed by Brigham LLC to the Original Owners on a per unit basis. This and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for our Class A common stock. We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, 1 or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of 1 or more classes or series of our preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of a class or series of our preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of our preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock. 49 Table of Contents For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies. We are classified as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things (i) provide an auditor attestation report on management assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2024, although we will lose that status so1r if we have more than $107 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700 million in market value of our Class A common stock held by non affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non convertible debt over a 3 year period. To the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If securities or industry analysts adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline. The trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If 1 or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if 1 or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline. Because we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of other public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and our stockholders and potential investors may have difficulty in analyzing our operating results by comparing us to such companies.
