Item 1 Business Overview Oasis Petroleum Inc. (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, we, us, or our ) was originally formed in 2007 and was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware in 2010. We are an independent exploration and production ( E&P ) company focused on the acquisition and development of onshore, unconventional crude oil and natural gas resources in the United States. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC ( OPNA ) and Oasis Petroleum Permian LLC ( OP Permian ) conduct our exploration and production activities and own our proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin and the Texas region of the Delaware Basin, respectively. In addition to our exploration and production segment, we also operate a midstream business segment through Oasis Midstream Partners LP (Nasdaq OMP) ( OMP ) and Oasis Midstream Services LLC ( OMS ). OMP is a growth oriented, fee based master limited partnership that develops and operates a diversified portfolio of midstream assets. We own a substantial majority of the general partner and a majority of the outstanding units of OMP. As of December 31, 2019, we operated a well services business segment through Oasis Well Services LLC ( OWS ). In March 2020, we intend to transition our well fracturing services from OWS to a third party provider who will provide services to us under a long term agreement. We believe this will result in continued quality service, while allowing us to focus on our core operations. As of December 31, 2019, we have accumulated 408,117 net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin, of which approximately 97% is held by production, and 24,995 net leasehold acres in the Delaware Basin, of which approximately 71% is held by production. In the Williston Basin, we are currently exploiting significant resource potential from the Bakken and 3 Forks formations, which are present across a substantial portion of our acreage. In the Delaware Basin, our development activities are focused on the B1 Springs and Wolfcamp formations, and we continue to increase our footprint to drive operational efficiencies. We believe the locations, size and concentration of our acreage in the Williston and Delaware Basins create an opportunity for us to achieve cost, recovery and production efficiencies through the development of our project inventory. Our management team has a proven track record in identifying, acquiring and executing large, repeatable development drilling programs, which we refer to as resource conversion opportunities, and has substantial Williston Basin and Delaware Basin experience. In 2019, we completed and placed on production 78 gross operated wells and had average daily production of 88,061 barrels of oil equivalent per day ( Boepd ) in the Williston and Delaware Basins. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,114 gross (820.9 net) operated producing horizontal wells in the Bakken and 3 Forks formations in the Williston Basin and 42 gross (39.5 net) operated producing horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2019, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, estimated our net proved reserves to be 2428 million barrels of oil equivalent ( MMBoe ) in the Williston Basin, of which 62% were classified as proved developed and 69% were crude oil, and net proved reserves to be 436 MMBoe in the Delaware Basin, of which 32% were classified as proved developed and 79% were crude oil. Our business Our goal is to enhance value by investing capital to build reserves, production and cash flows at attractive rates of return through the following strategic tactics Efficiently develop our Williston Basin and Delaware Basin leasehold positions. We are developing our acreage positions to achieve moderate production growth and attractive returns on invested capital in order to maximize the value of our resource potential, while generating free cash flow. During 2019, we completed and brought on production 67 gross (416 net) operated wells in the Williston Basin and 11 gross (9.9 net) operated wells in the Delaware Basin. Our 2020 capital plan contemplates completing and placing on production approximately 45 to 55 gross operated wells in the Williston Basin and approximately 20 to 25 gross operated wells in the Delaware Basin. We have the ability to increase or decrease the number of wells drilled and the number of wells completed during 2020 based on market conditions and program results. Enhance returns by focusing on operational and cost efficiencies. Our management team is focused on continuous improvement of our operations and has significant experience in successfully operating cost efficient development programs. The magnitude and concentration of our acreage within the Williston and Delaware Basins, particularly in the core of the plays, has provided and will continue to provide us with the opportunity to capture economies of scale, including the ability to drill multiple wells from a single drilling pad into multiple formations, utilize centralized production and crude oil, natural gas and water fluid handling facilities and infrastructure, and reduce the time and cost of rig mobilization. In addition, we expect our midstream business to continue to provide operational synergies. 4 Table of Content s Adopt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques. Our team is focused on enhancing our drilling and completion techniques to optimize overall project economics. We continuously evaluate our internal drilling and completion results and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices. We continue to optimize our completion designs based on geology and well spacing. Maintain financial flexibility. We are focused on generating free cash flow and reducing debt. We have no short term debt maturities, and as of December 31, 2019, we had $8827 million of liquidity available, including $20.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $8627 million in the aggregate of unused borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facilities (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Our liquidity position, along with expected cash flows from operations, will provide continued financial flexibility as we actively manage the pace of development on our acreage positions in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin. We continue to evaluate options to m1tize certain assets in our portfolio, which could result in increased liquidity and lower leverage. Pursue strategic acquisitions with significant resource potential. As opportunities arise, we intend to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets to supplement our existing operations. In 2019, we continued to increase our footprint in the Delaware Basin to drive operational efficiencies by acquiring an additional 1,800 highly complementary net acres. Going forward, we may acquire additional acreage in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin or may selectively target additional basins that would allow us to employ our resource conversion strategy on large undeveloped acreage positions similar to what we have accumulated in the Williston Basin. We also want to produce crude oil and natural gas in a responsible manner while meeting the expectations of a carbon constrained world, so we continue to focus on environmental, social and governance initiatives by identifying opportunities to minimize our environmental impact, improve safety, invest in our employees and support the communities in which we live and work. We are a recognized industry leader in the capture of the natural gas that we produce due to the proactive and significant investments we have made in our midstream business. As of December 31, 2019, we were capturing approximately 94% of our natural gas production in North Dakota, and our gas capture rate is over 10% higher than the overall average for North Dakota operators. We also provide leadership training and educational and professional development programs for employees at every level of the organization. Additionally, we conduct regular shareholder outreach campaigns focused on compensation practices and other governance topics; and our recently announced updates to our executive compensation program demonstrate our desire to maintain alignment of executive and shareholder interests. For more information about our corporate responsibility efforts, please see the Sustainability page of our website and the Proxy Statement that we will file for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Our competitive strengths We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will help us to successfully execute our business strategies Substantial leasehold position in 2 of North America leading unconventional crude oil resource plays. We believe our Williston Basin acreage is 1 of the largest concentrated leasehold positions that is prospective in the Bakken and 3 Forks formations. As of December 31, 2019, we had 408,117 net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin, of which 397,416 net acres were held by production, and 69% of our 2428 MMBoe estimated net proved reserves in this area were comprised of crude oil. In 2018, we made our initial entry into the Delaware Basin, 1 of the most prolific crude oil plays in North America, and we continue to build that position. As of December 31, 2019, we had 24,995 net leasehold acres in the Delaware Basin, of which 17,790 net acres were held by production, and 79% of our 436 MMBoe estimated net proved reserves in this area were comprised of crude oil. In 2020, we will continue our drilling and completion activities in both the Williston and Delaware Basins. Large, multi year project inventory. We believe we have a large inventory of potential drilling locations that we have not yet drilled, a majority of which are operated by us. We plan to complete approximately 45 to 55 gross operated wells with a working interest of approximately 66% in the Williston Basin and approximately 20 to 25 gross operated wells with a working interest of approximately 88% in the Delaware Basin in 2020. Management team with proven operating and acquisition skills. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the crude oil and natural gas industry with an average of more than 25 years of industry experience, including experience in multiple North American resource plays as well as experience in international basins. We believe our management and technical team is 1 of our principal competitive strengths relative to our industry peers due to our team proven track record in identification, acquisition and execution of resource conversion opportunities. In addition, our technical team possesses substantial expertise in horizontal drilling techniques and managing and acquiring large development programs. Incentivized management team. In 2019, an average of 75% of our executive officers overall compensation was in long term equity based incentive awards, and such officers owned approximately 4.8 million shares of our 5 Table of Content s outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. We believe our executive officers ownership interest in us provides them with significant incentives to grow the value of our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. We have also implemented a number of changes to our 2020 compensation program to further increase our management team alignment with our shareholders and our strategic objectives. Operating control over the majority of our portfolio. In order to maintain better control over our asset portfolio, we have established a leasehold position comprised primarily of properties that we expect to operate. As of December 31, 2019, 96% of our estimated net proved reserves were attributable to properties that we expect to operate. Approximately 95% and 92% of our drilling and completion capital expenditures related to operated wells in 2019 and in our 2020 plan, respectively. Controlling operations enables us to determine the pace of development and better manage the costs, type and timing of exploration and development activities. We believe that maintaining operational control over the majority of our acreage allows us to better pursue our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and capital efficiency. We are also better able to manage infrastructure investment to drive down operating costs and optimize crude oil, natural gas and NGL price realizations. Vertical integration. Our investment in and operational control of our midstream business provides us with additional operational efficiencies and cost savings compared to our peers. This vertical integration helps us control capital dollars being spent in advance of production to ensure volumes flow, improve uptime performance of our producing wells, protect against rising service costs and increase transparency in the planning process. Our operations exploration and production activities Proved reserves Our estimated net proved reserves and related PV 10 at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers. In preparing its reports, DeGolyer and MacNaughton evaluated 100% of the reserves and discounted values at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) applicable to companies involved in crude oil and natural gas producing activities. Our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV 10 and Standardized Measure do not include probable or possible reserves and were determined using the preceding twelve months unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month index prices for crude oil and natural gas, which were held constant throughout the life of the properties. The unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months were $55.85 per Bbl for crude oil and $262 per MMBtu for natural gas, $65.66 per Bbl for crude oil and $316 per MMBtu for natural gas and $5134 per Bbl for crude oil and $299 per MMBtu for natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The information in the following table does not give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives. Future operating costs, production taxes and capital costs were based on current costs as of each year end. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the Glossary of terms included at the end of this report. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent petroleum engineers below. Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of our estimated net proved reserves (excluding derivative contracts) net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). PV 10 and Standardized Measure represent the present value of the future net revenues discounted at 10%, before and after income taxes, respectively. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information, and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. There can be no assurance that our estimated net proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil prices could result in a significant decrease in our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV 10 in the future. 6 Table of Content s The following table summarizes our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV 10 At December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Estimated proved reserves Crude oil (MMBbls) 200.8 228.4 225.0 Natural gas (Bcf) 5135 5527 5235 Total estimated proved reserves (MMBoe) 286.4 320.5 3122 Percent crude oil 70 % 71 % 72 % Estimated proved developed reserves Crude oil (MMBbls) 1134 144.5 150.6 Natural gas (Bcf) 314.0 339.4 3011 Total estimated proved developed reserves (MMBoe) 165.8 2011 200.8 Percent proved developed 58 % 63 % 64 % Estimated proved undeveloped reserves Crude oil (MMBbls) 87.4 839 74.3 Natural gas (Bcf) 199.5 2133 2224 Total estimated proved undeveloped reserves (MMBoe) 120.6 119.4 1114 Future net revenues (in millions) $ 5,385.4 $ 8,3416 $ 6,185.4 Standardized Measure (in millions) (1) $ 2,844.4 $ 4,050.3 $ 3,300.7 PV 10 (in millions) (2) $ 2,934.4 $ 4,674.3 $ 3,6837 __________________ (1) Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, less estimated future development, production, plugging and abandonment costs and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows. (2) PV 10 is a non GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), because it does not include the effect of income taxes on discounted future net cash flows. Neither PV 10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The crude oil and natural gas industry uses PV 10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. See Reconciliation of PV 10 to Standardized Measure below. The following table provides additional information regarding our estimated net proved developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves by basin as of December 31, 2019 Proved Developed Proved Undeveloped Crude oil (MMBbls) Natural gas (Bcf) Total (MMBoe) Crude oil (MMBbls) Natural gas (Bcf) Total (MMBoe) Williston Basin 1024 295.5 1517 64.0 1625 911 Delaware Basin 110 18.5 14.1 233 37.0 29.5 Total 1134 314.0 165.8 87.3 199.5 120.6 Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2019 were 286.4 MMBoe, an 11% decrease from estimated net proved reserves of 320.5 MMBoe at December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases of 633 MMBoe for net negative revisions, 321 MMBoe for production and 25 MMBoe for divestitures of non strategic assets in the Williston Basin, partially offset by an increase of 639 MMBoe for additions. The net negative revisions were attributable to negative revisions of 512 MMBoe due to well performance, 112 MMBoe due to lower realized prices and 7.6 MMBoe associated with alignment to the five year development plan, offset by positive revisions of 6.7 MMBoe due to lower operating expenses. Our proved developed reserves decreased 35.3 MMBoe, or 18%, to 165.8 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 2011 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases of 37.5 MMBoe for net negative revisions, 321 MMBoe for production and 15 MMBoe for divestitures. These decreases were partially offset by our 2019 development program, which included 130 gross (521 net) wells that were completed and brought on production during 2019 and resulted in conversions of proved undeveloped reserves ( PUDs ) of 25.5 MMBoe and additions of 10.3 MMBoe. Proved developed revisions were primarily due to negative revisions of 30.2 MMBoe for performance largely related to higher than anticipated 7 Table of Content s decline rates in recently developed spacing units and 9.6 MMBoe due to lower realized prices, partially offset by positive revisions of 5.1 MMBoe due to lower operating expenses. Our proved undeveloped reserves increased 12 MMBoe, or 1%, to 120.6 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 119.4 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to additions of 536 MMBoe, offset by net negative revisions of 25.9 MMBoe, the conversion of wells to proved developed of 25.5 MMBoe and divestitures of 10 MMBoe. The proved undeveloped revisions were primarily due to negative revisions of 211 MMBoe for performance largely related to reductions in the anticipated hydrocarbon recoveries of proved areas during full field development due to changes in anticipated well densities and well performance and 7.0 MMBoe associated with alignment to the anticipated five year development plan, offset by positive revisions of 17 MMBoe due to lower operating expenses. See Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, refer to Item 1 Business Our operations exploration and production activities in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Reconciliation of Standardized Measure to PV 10 PV 10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV 10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre tax basis. PV 10 is equal to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV 10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative m1tary significance of our oil and gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and gas properties. PV 10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV 10 measure and the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our crude oil and natural gas reserves. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV 10 At December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 2,844.4 $ 4,050.3 $ 3,300.7 Add present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% 90.0 624.0 3830 PV 10 $ 2,934.4 $ 4,674.3 $ 3,6837 The PV 10 of our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2019 w as $2,934.4 million, a 37% decrease fro m PV 10 of $4,674.3 million at December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower commodity price assumptions and a decrease in reserves year over year. Proved undeveloped reserves At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 120.6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as compared to 119.4 MMBoe at December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the changes in our proved undeveloped reserves during 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2019 (MBoe) Proved undeveloped reserves, beginning of period 119,430 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 53,578 Sales of minerals in place (1,008) Revisions of previous estimates (25,859) Conversion to proved developed reserves (25,516) Proved undeveloped reserves, end of period 120,625 During 2019, we spent a total of $275.0 million related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, $627 million of which was spent on proved undeveloped reserves that represent wells in progress at year end. The remaining $2123 million resulted in the conversion of 25.5 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves, or 21% of our proved undeveloped reserves balance 8 Table of Content s at the beginning of 2019, to proved developed reserves. We added 536 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as a result of our five year development plan. The 2019 proved undeveloped revisions of 25.9 MMBoe were primarily due to negative revisions of 211 MMBoe for performance largely related to reductions in the anticipated hydrocarbon recoveries of proved areas during full field development due to changes in anticipated well densities and well performance and 7.0 MMBoe associated with alignment to the anticipated five year development plan, offset by positive revisions of 17 MMBoe due to lower operating expenses. We expect to develop all of our proved undeveloped reserves, including all wells drilled but not yet completed, as of December 31, 2019 within five years after the initial year booked. The future development of such proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts as well as access to liquidity sources, such as capital markets, the Oasis Credit Facility (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources ) and our derivative contracts. All proved undeveloped locations are located on properties where the leases are held by existing production or continuous drilling operations. Approximately 11% of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 are attributable to wells that have been drilled but not yet completed, and 77% and 23% of our undrilled reserves are within our core acreage in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, respectively. Independent petroleum engineers Our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues and PV 10 at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007) and definitions and current guidelines established by the SEC. DeGolyer and MacNaughton is a Delaware corporation with offices in Dallas, Houston, Moscow, Astana, Buenos Aries, Baku and Algiers. The firm more than 200 professionals include engineers, geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists and economists engaged in the appraisal of oil and gas properties, evaluation of hydrocarbon and other mineral prospects, basin evaluations, comprehensive field studies and equity studies related to the domestic and international energy industry. DeGolyer and MacNaughton has provided such services for over 80 years. The Senior Vice President at DeGolyer and MacNaughton primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas with over 30 years of experience in crude oil and natural gas reservoir studies and reserve evaluations. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 1984, and he is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. DeGolyer and MacNaughton restricts its activities exclusively to consultation; it does not accept contingency fees, nor does it own operating interests in any crude oil, natural gas or mineral properties, or securities or notes of clients. The firm subscribes to a code of professional conduct, and its employees actively support their related technical and professional societies. The firm is a Texas Registered Engineering Firm. Technology used to establish proved reserves In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in crude oil and natural gas producing activities, proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term reasonable certainty means deterministically, the quantities of crude oil and or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not, and probabilistically, there should be at least a 90% probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by using reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of 1 or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007) . The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by us to DeGolyer and MacNaughton and the analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved. 9 Table of Content s A performance based methodology integrating the appropriate geology and petroleum engineering data was utilized for the evaluation of all reserves categories. Performance based methodology primarily includes (i) production diagnostics, (ii) decline curve analysis and (iii) model based analysis (if necessary, based on the availability of data). Production diagnostics include data quality control, identification of flow regimes and characteristic well performance behavior. Analysis was performed for all well groupings (or type curve areas). Characteristic rate decline profiles from diagnostic interpretation were translated to modified hyperbolic rate profiles, including 1 or multiple b exp1nt values followed by an exp1ntial decline. Based on the availability of data, model based analysis may be integrated to evaluate long term decline behavior, the impact of dynamic reservoir and fracture parameters on well performance, and complex situations sourced by the nature of unconventional reservoirs. The methodology used for the analysis was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, production history and appropriate reserves definitions. Internal controls over reserves estimation process We employ DeGolyer and MacNaughton as the independent reserves evaluator for 100% of our reserves base. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with the independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished for the reserves estimation process. Brett Newton, Senior Vice President and Chief Engineer, is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing our reserves evaluation process. He has over 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and management. He holds both a Bachelor of Science degree and Master of Science degree in petroleum engineering. Mr. Newton reports directly to our President and Chief Operating Officer. Throughout each fiscal year, our technical team meets with the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss evaluation methods and assumptions used in the proved reserves estimates, in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures. Our internal controls over the reserves estimation process include verification of input data into our reserves evaluation software as well as management review, such as, but not limited to the following Comparison of historical expenses from the lease operating statements and workover authorizations for expenditure to the operating costs input in our reserves database; Review of working interests and net revenue interests in our reserves database against our well ownership system; Review of historical realized prices and differentials from index prices as compared to the differentials used in our reserves database; Review of updated capital costs prepared by our operations team; Review of internal reserve estimates by well and by area by our internal reservoir engineers; Discussion of material reserve variances among our internal reservoir engineers and our Senior Vice President and Chief Engineer; Review of a preliminary copy of the reserve report by our President and Chief Operating Officer with our internal technical staff; and Review of our reserves estimation process by our Audit Committee on an annual basis. Production, revenues, price and cost history We produce and market crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which are commodities. The price that we receive for the crude oil and natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, access to markets, weather and other seasonal conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Over or under supply of crude oil or natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Crude oil supply in the United States has grown dramatically over the past several years, putting downward pressure on crude oil prices. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the future. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil and natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices, in crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGL prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.

Net production in the Williston Basin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 29,524 MBoe as compared to net production of 28,544 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net production in the Delaware Basin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 2,618 MBoe as compared to net production of 1,578 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our net production in both the Williston and Delaware Basins increased year over year, primarily due to increases in natural gas production, coupled with a successful operated and non operated drilling and completion program, offset by the natural decline in production in wells that were producing as of December 31, 2018. Average crude oil sales prices, without derivative settlements, decreased by $6.57 per barrel, or 11%, to an average of $55.27 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Giving effect to our derivative transactions in both periods, our crude oil sales prices increased $324 per barrel to $55.89 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $5265 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, refer to Item 1 Business Our operations exploration and production activities in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. 11 Table of Content s Productive wells The following table presents the total and operated gross and net productive wells by basin as of December 31, 2019 Total wells Operated wells Gross Net Gross Net Williston Basin horizontal wells 1,486 864.6 1,114 820.9 Williston Basin other 1 10 1 10 Delaware Basin horizontal wells 137 40.1 42 39.5 Delaware Basin other 34 20.7 20 17.2 Total wells 1,658 926.4 1,177 878.6 All of our productive wells are crude oil wells.

Gross wells reflect the sum of all productive and dry wells, operated and non operated, in which we own a working interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells. The gross and net wells represent wells completed during the periods presented, regardless of when drilling was initiated. 12 Table of Content s Year ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Development wells Oil 123 46.2 135 84.2 153 630 Gas Dry Total development wells 123 46.2 135 84.2 153 630 Exploratory wells Oil 7 5.9 2 13 Gas Dry Total exploratory wells 7 5.9 2 13 Total wells 130 521 137 85.5 153 630 Over the past several years, we have focused on full field development and have concentrated on improving capital efficiency and completing more wells using high intensity completion techniques. We also continued to participate in a number of wells on a non operated basis. We participated in 130 gross (521 net) wells that were completed and brought on production during the year ended December 31, 2019. We did not drill any dry hole wells in 2019, 2018 or 2017. As of December 31, 2019, we had 84 gross (46.1 net) wells in the process of being drilled or completed in the Williston and Delaware Basins, which includes 3 gross operated wells drilling, 54 gross operated wells waiting on completion and 27 gross non operated wells drilling or completing. As of December 31, 2019, we had 3 operated rigs running and expect to run four operated rigs, 2 in both the Williston and Delaware Basins, while concentrating drilling activities within our top tier acreage in 2020. Capital expenditures In 2019, we spent $6310 million on capital expenditures, excluding midstream capital expenditures, which represented a 67% decrease as compared to the $1,925.8 million spent on capital expenditures, excluding midstream capital expenditures, during 2018. Excluding acquisitions of $210 million in 2019 and $9519 million in 2018, which includes the Permian Basin Acquisition (as defined in Item 1 Business Our operations exploration and production activities Description of properties Delaware Basin), our non midstream capital expenditures decreased to $610.0 million in 2019 from $974.0 million spent during 2018, which represented a 37% decrease year over year. This decrease was attributable to decreased drilling and completion activity as a result of lower commodity prices in 2019. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows used in investing activities. We have decreased our planned 2020 capital expenditures as compared to 2019, excluding acquisitions and midstream, as a result of current commodity prices. Our total 2020 capital expenditure plan, excluding midstream capital expenditures, is approximately $575 million to $595 million, which includes approximately $316 million to $387 million focused in the Williston Basin and approximately $201 million to $268 million focused in the Delaware Basin (with approximately 80 90% of the E&P capital allocated to drilling and completions). In addition, our 2020 planned capital expenditures includes other capital expenditures for administrative capital and excludes capitalized interest of approximately $125 million. We plan to complete and place on production approximately 45 to 55 gross operated wells in the Williston Basin and approximately 20 to 25 gross operated wells in the Delaware Basin in 2020. While we have planned approximately $575 million to $595 million in 2020 for these purposes, the ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and the success of our drilling results as the year progresses. Additionally, if we acquire additional acreage, our capital expenditures may be higher than planned. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Description of properties Williston Basin As of December 31, 2019, our operations were focused in the North Dakota and Montana areas of the Williston Basin. Our development activities are currently concentrated in the Bakken and 3 Forks formations. Our management team originally targeted the Williston Basin because of its oil pr1 nature, multiple producing horizons, substantial resource potential and 13 Table of Content s management previous professional history in the basin. The Williston Basin also generally has established infrastructure and access to materials and services. Our development activity is focused in the deepest part of the Williston Basin, which we call our top tier acreage. As of December 31, 2019, our total leasehold position in the Williston Basin consisted of 408,117 net acres, and we had a total of 865.6 net producing wells and 8219 net operated producing wells in the Williston Basin. We had average daily production of 80,889 net Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2019 in the Williston Basin. During 2019, our Bakken and 3 Forks wells produced a daily average of 80,876 net Boe per day with 820.9 net operated producing wells on December 31, 2019. Accordingly, our 820.9 net operated producing Bakken and 3 Forks wells were responsible for nearly 100% of our average daily production during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our working interest for all producing Bakken and 3 Forks wells averaged 58% and averaged 74% in the wells we operate. Delaware Basin In February 2018, we closed on an acquisition of approximately 22,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin (the Permian Basin Acquisition ), which represented our initial entry into the Delaware Basin. The assets underlying the Permian Basin Acquisition are primarily located in the B1 Spring and Wolfcamp formations of the Delaware sub basin, across Ward, Winkler, Loving and Reeves Counties, Texas. In 2019, we continued to increase our footprint in the Delaware Basin to drive operational efficiencies by acquiring an additional 1,800 highly complementary net acres. As of December 31, 2019, our total leasehold position in the Delaware Basin consisted of 24,995 net acres, and we had a total of 60.8 net producing wells and 56.7 net operated producing wells in the Delaware Basin. We had average daily production of 7,172 net Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2019 in the Delaware Basin. During 2019, our horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin produced a daily average of 6,915 net Boe per day with 39.5 net operated producing wells on December 31, 2019. Accordingly, our 39.5 net operated producing horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin were responsible for nearly 96% of our average daily production during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our working interest for all producing horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin averaged 29% and in the wells we operate averaged 94%. Continuous Development Agreement. In connection with the closing of the Permian Basin Acquisition, Forge Energy, LLC ( Forge Energy ) entered into and assigned to OP Permian a continuous development agreement with the Commissi1r of the General Land Office, on behalf of the State of Texas (collectively, the State ), as approved by the Board for Lease of University Lands (the Board, and together with the State, University Lands ). This agreement concerns certain leases covering a substantial portion of the acreage that the Company indirectly acquired from Forge Energy in the Permian Basin Acquisition and under which University Lands is the lessor. Pursuant to this agreement, the tracts covered by these leases are pooled into a single development area for which the Company indirectly holds an eight year initial term ending on December 31, 2025, with an additional five year term for certain retained acreage at certain depths in the Delaware, B1 Springs and Wolfcamp formations. If OP Permian fails to meet certain drilling and development obligations, this agreement may be subject to early termination, in which case, the additional five year term would begin on such date and we may be obligated to pay non performance fees of up to approximately $100 million. Marketing, transportation and major customers The Williston Basin crude oil rail and pipeline transportation and refining infrastructure has grown substantially over the past decade, largely in response to drilling activity in the Bakken and 3 Forks formations. In December 2019, crude oil production in North Dakota was approximately 1,476,000 barrels per day. According to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority website data last updated February 14, 2020, there was approximately 1,381,000 barrels per day of combined crude oil pipeline transportation and refining capacity and approximately 1,305,000 barrels per day of specifically dedicated rail loading capacity in the Williston Basin as of December 31, 2019. In 2019, we continued to sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to multiple pipeline and rail facilities. These gathering systems, which typically originate at the wellhead, reduce the need to transport barrels by truck from the wellhead. As of December 31, 2019, we were flowing approximately 93% of our gross operated crude oil production through these gathering systems in the Williston Basin. In the Delaware Basin, approximately 70% of our gross operated crude oil production was connected to crude oil gathering systems as of December 31, 2019. Crude oil produced and sold in the Williston Basin has historically sold at a discount to the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil index price ( NYMEX WTI ) due to transportation costs and takeaway capacity. In the past, there have been periods when this discount has substantially increased due to the production of crude oil in the area increasing to a point that it temporarily surpasses the available pipeline transportation, rail transportation and refining capacity in the area. Expansions of both rail and pipeline facilities have reduced the prior constraint on crude oil transportation out of the Williston Basin and improved basin differentials received at the lease. In the fourth quarter of 2019, as production increased and existing pipelines in the Williston Basin were running again at peak rates, rail transportation increased and the differentials widened to more than $350 per barrel below NYMEX WTI. However, additional transportation capacity is expected to come on line beginning in mid 2020, and we expect the differential to compress again to mid 2019 levels. In the Delaware Basin, price differentials in the 14 Table of Content s first half of 2019 averaged more than $5.00 per barrel below NYMEX WTI due to pipeline constraints. Expansions of pipelines began to occur in mid 2019 which greatly reduced these differentials, which became positive to NYMEX WTI by year end. For a discussion of the potential risks to our business that could result from transportation and refining infrastructure constraints in the Williston Basin, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business Insufficient transportation, end market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices. We principally sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production to refiners, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline and rail facilities. Our marketing of crude oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For a description of some of these factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs markets or delay our production and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business Insufficient transportation, end market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices. In an effort to improve price realizations from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas, we manage our commodities marketing activities in house, which enables us to market and sell our crude oil and natural gas to a broad array of potential purchasers. As of December 31, 2019, we sold a substantial majority of our crude oil and condensate through bulk sales at delivery points on crude oil gathering systems to a variety of purchasers at prevailing market prices under short term contracts that normally provide for us to receive a market based price, which incorporates regional differentials that include, but are not limited to, transportation costs. In addition, from time to time we may enter into third party purchase and sales transactions that allow us to optimize our advantageous gathering and transportation positions and increase the value of our crude oil price realizations. We also entered into various short term sales contracts for a portion of our portfolio at fixed differentials. Due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections, we do not believe that the loss of any single crude oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Phillips 66 Company accounted for approximately 14% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no purchaser accounted for more than 10% of the Company total sales from the exploration and production segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 16% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017. We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are a number of alternative crude oil and natural gas purchasers in the Williston and Delaware Basins. Since most of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold under market based or spot market contracts, the revenues generated by our operations are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including but not limited to seasonality, weather, competition, availability of transportation and gathering capabilities, worldwide and regional economic conditions, global and domestic crude oil supply, foreign imports, political conditions in other crude oil producing and natural gas producing regions, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and domestic government regulation, legislation and policies. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices, in crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGL prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. Furthermore, a decrease in the price of crude oil and natural gas could have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our estimated proved reserves and on our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business If crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, we may be required to take write downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. Market, economic, transportation and regulatory factors may in the future materially affect our ability to market our crude oil or natural gas production. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs markets or delay our production. Our operations midstream services We continue to develop our midstream business, which includes natural gas gathering, compression and processing, produced and flowback water gathering and disposal, fresh water supply and distribution and crude oil gathering and transportation. Our midstream assets are strategically located in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin and support our upstream operations. These assets also provide services to third party customers. 15 Table of Content s Our midstream operations include those of OMP, a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary and limited partnership that owns, develops, operates and acquires a diversified portfolio of midstream assets in North America. OMP is a growth oriented, fee based master limited partnership we formed in 2014 and organized in a development company structure. On September 25, 2017, OMP completed its initial public offering ( IPO ) of common units. At December 31, 2019, our ownership interest in OMP consisted of a 67.5% limited partner interest and 91% controlling interest in its general partner interest, which owns all of OMP incentive distribution rights and its non economic general partner interest. OMP conducts its operations through its four development companies (collectively, the DevCos ) Bighorn DevCo LLC ( Bighorn DevCo ), Bobcat DevCo LLC ( Bobcat DevCo ), Beartooth DevCo LLC ( Beartooth DevCo ) and Panther DevCo LLC ( Panther DevCo ). In the Williston Basin, OMP divides its operations into 2 primary areas with developed midstream infrastructure, both of which are supported by significant acreage dedications from us. In Wild Basin, we have dedicated acreage to OMP in which OMP has the right to provide crude oil, natural gas and water services to support our existing and future volumes. Outside of Wild Basin, we have dedicated acreage to OMP for produced and flowback water services and freshwater services. OMP expanded its operations to the Delaware Basin in the fourth quarter of 2019 when, effective November 1, 2019, we agreed to assign to Panther DevCo certain crude oil gathering and produced and flowback water gathering and disposal assets (the Delaware Midstream Assets ), which were already under development by OMS, to support our production in the Delaware Basin. Also on November 1, 2019, Panther DevCo entered into long term commercial agreements with us, pursuant to which we dedicated acreage in the Delaware Basin to OMP for crude oil gathering and produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services. In addition, OMP has received certain commitments from third parties in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, in which OMP has the right to provide its full suite of midstream services to support existing and future third party volumes. Contractual arrangements We have entered into several long term, fee based contractual arrangements with OMP for midstream services, including (i) natural gas gathering, compression, processing and gas lift services; (ii) crude oil gathering, stabilization, blending, storage and transportation services; (iii) produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services; and (iv) freshwater supply and distribution services. In addition, we provide substantial labor and overhead support for OMP. Upon completion of the OMP IPO, we entered into a 15 year services and secondment agreement with OMP pursuant to which we provide all personnel, equipment, electricity, chemicals and services (including third party services) required for OMP to operate such assets, and OMP reimburses us for its share of the actual costs of operating such assets. In addition, pursuant to the services and secondment agreement, we perform centralized corporate, general and administrative services for OMP, such as legal, corporate recordkeeping, planning, budgeting, regulatory, accounting, billing, business development, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, investor relations, cash management and banking, payroll, internal audit, taxes and engineering. We have also seconded to OMP certain of its employees to operate, construct, manage and maintain its assets, and OMP reimburses us for direct general and administrative expenses we incurred for the provision of the above services. The expenses of executive officers and non executive employees are allocated to OMP based on the amount of time spent managing its business and operations. OMP public offering and dropdown On November 14, 2018, OMP completed a public offering of 2,300,000 common units (including 300,000 common units issued pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional common units) representing limited partnership interests, at a price to the public of $20.00 per common unit. OMP received net proceeds from the public offering of approximately $44.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs, which were used to fund a portion of its acquisition of additional ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo. In connection with the OMP public offering, on November 19, 2018, OMP acquired an additional 15% ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo increasing its ownership to 25% and an additional 30% ownership interest in Beartooth DevCo increasing its ownership to 70% in exchange for consideration of $2514 million ( OMP Dropdown ) as of December 31, 2018. The $2514 million consideration consisted of $1724 million in cash and 3,950,000 common units representing limited partner interests in OMP. OMP funded the cash portion of the consideration with a combination of borrowings under the revolving credit facility among OMP, as parent, OMP Operating LLC, a subsidiary of OMP, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the OMP Credit Facility ) and proceeds from its public offering of common units. After the OMP Dropdown, we owned 75% of the non controlling interests of Bobcat DevCo and 30% of the non controlling interests of Beartooth DevCo as of December 31, 2018. 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement On February 22, 2019, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (the MOU ) with OMP regarding the funding of Bobcat DevCo expansion capital expenditures for the 2019 calendar year (the 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement ). Pursuant to the MOU, in exchange for increasing its percentage ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo, OMP agreed to make up 16 Table of Content s to $80.0 million of the capital contributions to Bobcat DevCo that OMS would otherwise have been required to contribute. During the year ended December 31, 2019, OMP made capital contributions to Bobcat DevCo pursuant to the 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement of $730 million. As a result, OMS ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo decreased from 75% as of December 31, 2018 to 64.7% as of December 31, 2019. The 2019 Capital Expenditures Arrangement ended on December 31, 2019. Capital expenditures In 2019, midstream capital expenditures were primarily related to the growth of natural gas gathering and compression to connect Oasis and third party wells to the Wild Basin gas processing complex. Additional capital was spent on the gas processing complex as well as crude oil gathering and produced water gathering and disposal for Oasis and third party customers. Total midstream capital expenditures have decreased year over year, and our planned 2020 midstream capital expenditures are expected to approximate $110 million to $120 million, which includes $68 million to $75 million attributable to OMP. Competition The crude oil and natural gas industry is worldwide and highly competitive in all phases. We encounter competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operation, including the acquisition of leasing options on oil and gas properties to the exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies, numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well established companies that have substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. Such companies may be able to pay more for lease options on oil and gas properties and exploratory locations and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business Competition in the crude oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel. Title to properties As is customary in the crude oil and gas industry, we initially conduct a preliminary review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant title defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with general industry standards. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing crude oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of the properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens to secure borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect our carrying value of the properties. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest. Seasonality Winter weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities and other crude oil and natural gas operations. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations. Regulation of the crude oil and natural gas industry Our crude oil and natural gas producing, midstream and well services operations are substantially affected by federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, crude oil and natural gas production, crude oil gathering and transportation, natural gas processing and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for crude oil and natural gas production or otherwise provide midstream services have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas or the gathering, transportation and processing of those commodities, including provisions related to permits for the 17 Table of Content s drilling of wells or processing of natural gas, bonding requirements to drill or operate producing or injection wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled or processing plants are constructed, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area, the siting of processing plants, disposal wells and gathering or transportation lines, and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs with applicable laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations; however, new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may occur and, thus, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Additionally, environmental incidents such as spills or other releases may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the crude oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may be finalized and become effective. Regulation of transportation and sales of crude oil Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. FERC regulates interstate crude oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate crude oil pipeline rates must be cost based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for crude oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index, without making a cost of service filing. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC crude oil index to change transportation rates annually every July 1, and our Bighorn DevCo Johnson Corner line will utilize the FERC crude oil index beginning on July 1, 2022 Every five years, FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. Most recently, on December 17, 2015, FERC established a new price index for the five year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, in which common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price Index plus 123%. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related issuances, FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes ( Revised Policy Statement ) stating that, among other things and with respect to crude oil and refined products pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction, the pipeline is required to reflect the impacts to its cost of service from the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act ) on Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6. This information will be used by FERC in its next five year review of the crude oil pipeline index to generate the index level to be effective July 1, 2021, thereby including the effect of the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Act in the determination of indexed rates prospectively, effective July 1, 2021 FERC establishment of a just and reasonable rate, including the determination of the appropriate crude oil pipeline index, is based on many comp1nts, and tax related changes will affect 2 such comp1nts, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect FERC determination of the appropriate pipeline index. Accordingly, depending on FERC application of its indexing rate methodology for the next five year term of index rates, the Revised Policy Statement and tax effects related to the Tax Act may impact our revenues associated with any transportation services we may provide pursuant to cost of service based rates in the future, including indexed rates. Intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate crude oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of crude oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier crude oil pipelines must provide service on a non discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When crude oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by prorationing 18 Table of Content s provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to crude oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors. We sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to rail facilities. Due to several crude oil train derailments in the past decade, transportation safety regulators in the United States and Canada have examined the adequacy of transporting crude oil by rail, with an emphasis on the safe transport of Bakken crude oil by rail, following findings by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) that Bakken crude oil tends to be more volatile and flammable than certain other crude oils, and thus poses an increased risk for a significant accident. Since 2011, all new railroad tank cars that have been built to transport crude oil or other petroleum type fluids, including ethanol, have been built to more stringent safety standards. In 2015, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, additional requirements to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol, a classification and testing program for crude oil, new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids and a requirement that older DOT 111 tank cars be phased out beginning in October 2017 if they are not already retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards. In 2016, PHMSA released a final rule mandating a phase out schedule for all DOT 111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029, and more recently in February 2019, PHMSA published a final rule requiring railroads to develop and submit comprehensive oil spill response plans for specific route segments traveled by a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train. Additionally, the February 2019 final rule requires railroads to establish geographic response z1s along various rail routes, ensure that both personnel and equipment are staged and prepared to respond in the event of an accident, and share information about high hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions. In addition to these or other actions taken or proposed by federal agencies, a number of states proposed or enacted laws in recent years that encourage safer rail operations, urge the federal government to strengthen requirements for these operations or otherwise seek to impose more stringent standards on rail transport of crude oil. For example, in the absence of a current federal standard on the vapor pressure of crude oil transported by rail, the State of Washington passed a law that became effective on July 28, 2019, prohibiting the loading or unloading of crude oil from a rail car in the state unless the crude oil vapor pressure is lower than 9 pounds per square inch. In response, the States of North Dakota and Montana filed a preemption application with PHMSA in July 2019, in which the states seek to have PHMSA make an administrative determination and override the Washington State vapor pressure limits. In July 2019, PHMSA published an invitation for public comments on the preemption application, which comment period closed in the latter half of 2019, with no administrative determination yet being released. Safety improvements or updates to existing tank cars, together with more stringent requirements relating to response planning, equipment and personnel staging preparedness, and establishment of geographic response z1s that are imposed under PHMSA final rules could drive up the cost of transport and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars. However, we cannot assure that costs incurred by the railroad industry to comply with these enhanced standards resulting from PHMSA final rules or that restrictions on rail transport of crude oil due to state crude oil volatility standards, if not preempted by PHSMA, will not increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices, the consequences of which could be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we believe that any such consequences would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. Efforts are likewise underway in Canada to assess and address risks from the transport of crude oil by rail. For example, in 2014, Transport Canada issued a protective order prohibiting crude oil shippers from using 5,000 of the DOT 111 tank cars and imposing a 3 year phase out period for approximately 65,000 tank cars that do not meet certain safety requirements. Transport Canada also imposed a 50 mile per hour speed limit on trains carrying hazardous materials and required all crude oil shipments in Canada to have an emergency response plan. At the same time that PHMSA released its 2015 rule, Canada Minister of Transport announced Canada new tank car standards, which largely align with the requirements in the PHMSA rule. Likewise, Transport Canada rail car retrofitting and phase out timeline largely aligns with the timeline introduced under the 2015 and 2016 PHMSA rules. Transport Canada has also introduced new requirements that railways carry minimum levels of insurance depending on the quantity of crude oil or dangerous goods that they transport as well as a final report recommending additional practices for the transportation of dangerous goods. Both Transport Canada and PHMSA issued final rules during 2018 that further harmonize their respective tank car standards, including with respect to tank car approvals and design requirements. Historically, our hazardous materials transportation compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement regarding hazardous material transportation may occur in the future, which could directly and indirectly increase our operation, compliance and transportation costs and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with standards and regulations emerging from these existing and any future rulemakings will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, 19 Table of Content s we may incur significant constraints on transportation capacity during the period while tank cars are being retrofitted or newly constructed to comply with the new regulations. In addition, any derailment of crude oil from the Bakken shale or Delaware Basin involving crude oil that we have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities. Although we believe that we are adequately insured against such events, we cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover the entirety of any damages that may arise from such an event. N1theless, we believe that any such consequences would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 ( NGA ), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ( NGPA ) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non discriminatory basis. FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, FERC issued a series of orders, beginning with Order No. 636, to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines traditional role of providing the sale and transportation of natural gas as a single service has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. In 2000, FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 revised FERC pricing policy by waiving price ceilings for short term released capacity for a 2 year experimental period, and effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by FERC under Order No. 637 will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers. The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities, we are required to observe anti market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). Please see below the discussion of Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry Energy Policy Act of 2005. Should we violate the anti market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, pursuant to Order No. 704, some of our operations may be required to annually report to FERC on May 1 of each year for the previous calendar year. Order No. 704 requires certain natural gas market participants to report information regarding their reporting of transactions to price index publishers and their blanket sales certificate status, as well as certain information regarding their wholesale, physical natural gas transactions for the previous calendar year depending on the volume of natural gas transacted. Please see below the discussion of Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry FERC market transparency rules. Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC determinations as to the classification of facilities is d1 on a case by case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas 20 Table of Content s transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Regulation of production The production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. We own and operate properties in North Dakota, Montana and Texas, which have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, all 3 states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs within their jurisdictions. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the crude oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry Energy Policy Act of 2005 On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( EPAct 2005 ). EPAct 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. EPAct 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,291,894 per day, adjusted annually for inflation, for violations of the NGA and increases FERC civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,291,894 per violation per day, adjusted annually for inflation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rule makes it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sales or gathering, but do apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as described below. The anti manipulation rules and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC NGA enforcement authority. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. FERC market transparency rules On December 26, 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 22 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, natural gas marketers and natural gas producers, are required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC policy statement on price reporting. Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the FTC issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale from (a) knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or 21 Table of Content s deceit upon any person; or (b) intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1,231,690 per day per violation, adjusted annually for inflation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Texas Railroad Commission crude oil and natural gas rules The Texas Railroad Commission (the RRC ), through its Oil and Gas Division, regulates the exploration, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas in Texas. Among other duties, the RRC develops and adopts regulations to prevent waste of the state crude oil and natural resources, protects the correlative rights of different interest owners, prevents pollution and provides safety with respect to operations including, for example, hydrogen sulfide emissions. The RRC grants drilling permits based on established spacing, density and special field rules. Additionally, each month, the RRC assigns production allowables on crude oil and natural gas wells based on factors such as tested well capability, reservoir mechanics, market demand for production and past production, as well as receives operators production reports on crude oil leases and gas wells and audits the crude oil disposition path to ensure production did not exceed allowables. The RRC also regulates crude oil field injection and disposal wells under a federally approved program that includes permitting, annual reporting and periodic testing activities. Through this program, fluids are injected into either productive reservoirs under enhanced recovery projects to increase production or into productive or non productive reservoirs for disposal. In other pollution prevention activities, the RRC assures waste management is carried out by permitting pits and landfarming, discharges, waste haulers, waste minimization and hazardous waste management tasks. To prevent pollution of the state surface and ground water resources, the RRC has an aband1d well plugging and aband1d site remediation program that uses funds provided by industry through fees and taxes. Wells and sites are remediated with funds from this program when responsible operators cannot be found. Moreover, flaring of natural gas is subject to regulation by the RRC under its rules, but those rules allow for permitted exceptions through the use of flare permits. Flaring may provide crude oil and natural gas producers with an approved means for continuing crude oil production under certain scenarios, such as, for example, when there may be insufficient pipeline infrastructure in place to transport natural gas to market or to prevent resource waste. The imposition of more stringent requirements by the RRC or as a result of litigation contesting such flare permit practice that lessen producers opportunities to flare under RRC permitted exceptions could result in reduced production, which development could have an adverse effect on our and similarly situated producers business and results of operations. North Dakota Industrial Commission crude oil and natural gas rules The North Dakota Industrial Commission (the NDIC ) regulates the drilling and production of oil and natural gas in North Dakota. Beginning in 2012, the NDIC adopted more stringent rules, imposing increased bonding amounts for the drilling of wells, severely restricting the discharge and storage of production wastes such as produced water, drilling mud, waste oil and other wastes in earthen pits, implementing more stringent hydraulic fracturing requirements and requiring the provision of public disclosure on FracFocus.org regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In 2016, the NDIC approved a suite of additional rules for the conservation of crude oil and natural gas, including new requirements relating to site construction, underground gathering pipelines, spill containment bonding requirements for underground gathering pipelines, and construction of berms around facilities, which new requirements are now in effect. On April 1, 2020, new oil and gas rules are expected to be issued by the NDIC that focus primarily on permitting requirements for treating plants, saltwater handling facilities and underground injection control procedures. These requirements have increased or will increase the well costs incurred by us and similarly situated crude oil and natural gas E&P operators, and we expect to continue to incur these increased costs as well as any added costs arising from new NDIC legal requirements laws and regulations applicable to the drilling and production of crude oil and natural gas that may be issued in the future. Furthermore, in 2014, the NDIC adopted an order intended to reduce natural gas flaring, which order was subsequently modified in late 2015 and the underlying flaring program policy goals were revised in November 2018. Please see below the discussion of Environmental protection and natural gas flaring initiatives for more information on this order and the program. In addition, in 2014, the NDIC adopted conditioning standards that are now in effect and improve the safety of Bakken crude oil for transport. Among other things, the 2014 rule sets operating standards for conditioning equipment to properly separate production fluids, addresses limits to the vapor pressure of produced crude oil, and includes parameters for temperatures and pressures associated with the production equipment. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors. Pipeline safety regulation Certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act ( HLPSA ) with respect to crude oil and condensates and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act ( NGPSA ) with respect to natural gas. The 22 Table of Content s HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of hazardous liquid and gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain relatively higher risk areas, known as high consequence areas ( HCA ) and moderate consequence areas ( MCA ) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. The HCAs for natural gas pipelines are predicated on high population areas (which, for natural gas transmission pipelines, may include Class 3 and Class 4 areas) whereas HCAs for crude oil, NGL and condensate pipelines are based on high population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. An MCA is attributable to natural gas pipelines and is based on high population areas as well as certain principal, high capacity roadways, though it does not meet the definition of a natural gas pipeline HCA. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. Legislation in recent years has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the Pipeline, Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act ). The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act ) was passed, extending PHMSA statutory mandate through September 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued an interim rule in 2016 and a final rule on October 1, 2019 to implement the agency expanded authority to address such conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment. Because the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized PHMSA hazardous liquid and gas pipeline programs only through September 30, 2019, we anticipate that Congress will issue an updated pipeline safety law in 2020 that will reauthorize those programs through 2023 The adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, on October 1, 2019, PHMSA published a final rule for hazardous liquid transmission and gathering pipelines that becomes effective July 1, 2020 and significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA hazardous liquid integrity management requirements, regardless of the pipeline proximity to a HCA (for example, integrity assessments at least once every 10 years of onshore, piggable, hazardous liquid pipeline segments located outside of HCAs, and expanded use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated hazardous liquid pipelines other than offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines). The final rule also requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting a HCA to be capable of accommodating in line inspection tools within the next 20 years unless the basic construction of a pipeline cannot be modified to permit that accommodation. Also, this final rule extends annual, accident, and safety related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and also imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure. In a second example, in 2016, PHMSA announced a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines in newly defined MCAs that contain as few as five dwellings within a potential impact area; requiring gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus excluded from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures ( MAOP ); and requiring certain onshore and offshore gathering lines in Class I areas to comply with damage prevention, corrosion control, public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning standards. Additional requirements proposed by this proposed rulemaking would increase PHMSA integrity management requirements for gas pipelines and also require consideration of seismicity in evaluating threats to pipelines. PHMSA has since decided to split its 2016 proposed rule, which has become known as the gas mega rule, into 3 separate rulemaking proceedings to facilitate completion. The first of these 3 rulemakings, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, was published as a final rule on October 1, 2019, becomes effective on July 1, 2020, and imposes numerous requirements on such pipelines, including MAOP reconfirmation, the assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (including all MCAs and those Class 3 and Class 4 areas found not to be in HCAs) within 14 years of publication date and at least once every 10 years thereafter, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of 23 Table of Content s seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. The remaining rulemakings comprising the gas mega rule are expected to be issued in 2020. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines. Environmental and occupational health and safety regulation Our exploration, development and production operations, crude oil gathering and transportation activities, natural gas processing services and related operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling or provide midstream services; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions; impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites, pits, processing plants and pipelines; and impose specific criteria addressing worker protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any new laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental spills or other releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including any third party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While, historically, our compliance costs with environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future as a result of such existing laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations, or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. Hazardous substances and wastes The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( CERCLA ), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These classes of persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. We are also subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Under the authority of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA less stringent nonhazardous waste provisions, state 24 Table of Content s laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in response to a federal consent decree issued in 2016, the EPA was required during 2019 to determine whether certain Subtitle D criteria regulations required revision in a manner that could result in oil and natural gas wastes being regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes. In April 2019, the EPA made a determination that such revision of the regulations was unnecessary. Repeal or modification of the current RCRA exclusion or similar exemptions under state law could increase the amount of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as reduce demand for our midstream and well services. We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas or for conducting midstream services. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from, other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial plugging or pit, processing plant or pipeline closure operations to prevent future contamination. Air emissions The federal Clean Air Act ( CAA ) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of various air pollutants from many sources through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. Obtaining permits has the potential to restrict, delay or cancel the development or expansion of crude oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) for ground level oz1 to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground level oz1 and has issued final requirements that apply to state, local and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground level oz1 State implementation of these revised standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay, limit or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with this final rule or any other new legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce, which 1 or more developments could adversely impact our production, midstream and well services businesses. Environmental protection and natural gas flaring initiatives We attempt to conduct our operations in a manner that protects the health, safety and welfare of the public, our employees and the environment. We are focused on the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites. The rapid growth of crude oil production in North Dakota in recent years, coupled with a historical lack of natural gas gathering infrastructure in the state, has led to efforts to reduce flaring of natural gas produced in association with crude oil production. We recognize the environmental and financial risks associated with natural gas flaring, and we seek to manage these risks on an ongoing basis, consistent with applicable requirements. We believe that 1 of the leading causes of natural gas flaring from the Bakken and 3 Forks formations is the inability of operators to promptly connect their wells to natural gas processing and gathering infrastructure due to external factors out of the control of the operator, such as, for example, the granting of right of way access by land owners, investment from third parties in the development of gas gathering systems and processing facilities, and the development and adoption of regulations. However, we have allocated significant resources to connect our Bakken and 3 Forks wells to natural gas infrastructure to reduce our flared volumes. We have exceeded a goal that we voluntarily set in 2014 to maintain well connections for an average of 90% of our operated Bakken and 3 Forks wells, by having approximately 98% of our operated Bakken and 3 Forks wells connected to gathering systems since 2015. We believe that achieving this goal helps us to minimize our flared volumes of natural gas. In 2014, the NDIC adopted Order No. 24665 (the 2014 Order ), pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable gas capture percentage goals targeting the capture of natural gas produced in the state between October 1, 2014 and October 25 Table of Content s 1, 2020. Modification of the July 2014 Order by the NDIC in late 2015, resulted in revised gas capture percentage goals of 88% and 91% required to be achieved by November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2020, respectively. Most recently, in November 2018, the NDIC considered revising its 2018 and 2020 gas capture percentage goals but elected to retain those standards; however, the NDIC revised the flaring program policy goals such that the crude oil and gas exploration and production industry has more flexibility in removing certain gas volumes from consideration in calculating compliance with the state gas capture percentage goals. The NDIC continues to adhere to other aspects of the modified 2014 Order, including development of Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency gas capture percentage goals. Also, wells must continue to meet or exceed the NDIC gas capture percentage goals on a statewide, county, per field, or per well basis. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficiency rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of crude oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise crude oil production from such wells shall not exceed 100 barrels of oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider flexibility to these production restrictions, by means of temporary exemptions, for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect of such flexibility is a significant net increase in gas capture within 1 year of the date such relief is granted. M1tary penalty provisions also apply under this policy in the event an operator who is not meeting the gas capture percentage goals fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. In late 2019, the overall natural gas capture rate for producers in North Dakota failed to attain the current statewide gas capture rate of 88%, and the gas capture rate will increase to 91% on November 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we were capturing approximately 94% of our natural gas production in North Dakota. While we were satisfying the applicable gas capture percentage goals as of December 31, 2019 and expect to satisfy the November 1, 2020 gas capture percentage goals of 91%, there is no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future or that such future satisfaction of such goals will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Climate change Climate change continues to attract considerable public, political and scientific attention. As a result, numerous regulatory initiatives have been made, and are likely to continue to be made, at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. These regulatory efforts have included consideration of cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Additionally, the threat of climate change has resulted in increasing political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. The adoption and implementation of any federal or state legislation, regulations or executive orders or the occurrence of any litigation or financial developments that impose more stringent requirements or bans on GHG emitting production activities or locations where such production activities may occur, impose liabilities for past conduct relating to GHG emitting production activities or limit or eliminate sources of financing for on going production operations could require our E&P customers to incur increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas that, in turn, could reduce demand for our products and services. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our E&P and midstream operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of concerns regarding the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs and costs of compliance, limit the areas in which crude oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce or provide midstream services for while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production or midstream services and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects for additional information relating to risks arising out of climate change including the emission of GHGs. Water discharges The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean Water Act ) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps ) under the Obama Administration issued a final rule outlining their position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. In 2017, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, in October 2019, the agencies published a final rule made effective on December 23, 2019, rescinding the 2015 rule. On January 23, 2020, the 2 agencies issued a final rule re defining the Clean Water Act jurisdiction over waters of the 26 Table of Content s United States, which redefinition is narrower than found in the 2015 rule. Upon being published in the Federal Register and the passage of 60 days thereafter, the January 23, 2020 final rule will become effective, at which point the United States will be covered under a single regulatory scheme as it relates to federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. However, there remains the expectation that the January 23, 2020 final rule also will be legally challenged in federal district court. To the extent that any challenge to the January 23, 2020 final rule is successful and the 2015 rule or revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act jurisdiction in areas where we conduct operations, our drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays or cancellations with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which could reduce demand for our production. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the OPA ) amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of crude oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including E&P facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for crude oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from crude oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of crude oil into waters of the United States. Operations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non producing subsurface formations. These injection wells are regulated pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the SDWA ) Underground Injection Control (the UIC ) program and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or analogous state agency for disposal wells that we operate, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of fresh water, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Moreover, any changes in the laws or regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of our operations, which costs could be significant. Furthermore, in response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of produced water from crude oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas as being among six states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or crude oil and natural gas extraction. Since that time, the United States Geological Survey indicates that these rates have decreased in these states, although concern continues to exist over quakes arising from induced seismic activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in Texas, the RRC has adopted rules governing the permitting or re permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of crude oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or our customers. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in operational activities, our or our customers costs to operate may significantly increase and our or our customers ability to continue production or conduct midstream services or dispose of produced water may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Hydraulic fracturing activities Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from unconventional formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities, as well as published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking ( ANPR ) regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also 27 Table of Content s issued final CAA regulations in 2012 and 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during crude oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing or from compressors, controls, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, and certain other equipment. In addition, the EPA has published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional crude oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The federal Bureau of Land Management (the BLM ) published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM decision to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in federal district court. From time to time Congress has considered, but has not adopted, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. However, the threat of climate change has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate related pledges to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells being made by certain candidates seeking the office of President of the United States in 2020. In addition, some states, including North Dakota and Texas where we primarily operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to adopt certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Nevertheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions or bans relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, or in the future plan to operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience restrictions, delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be limited or precluded from drilling wells or in the volume that the Company is ultimately able to produce from its reserves. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, crude oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to added delays, restrictions or cancellations in the pursuit of our operations or increased operating costs in our or our customers production of crude oil and natural gas. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new crude oil and natural gas wells, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations with respect to E&P activities and midstream services. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks. Endangered Species Act considerations The federal Endangered Species Act (the ESA ) and comparable state laws may restrict exploration, development and production activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States and prohibits the taking of endangered species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed or endangered species or modify their critical habitats. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered or threatened species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we or our customers wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed by seasonal or permanent restrictions or require the implementation of expensive mitigation. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may make determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA and litigation with respect to the listing or non listing of certain species as endangered or threatened may result in more fulsome protections for non protected or lesser protected species pursuant to specific timelines. The designation of unidentified threatened or endangered species or the re designation of under protected species in areas where underlying property operations are conducted or planned could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in delays or limitations on our or our customers E&P activities, including the performance of drilling programs that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves or an indirect adverse impact on the demand for our midstream services. Operations on federal lands 28 Table of Content s Performance of crude oil and natural gas E&P activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the BLM are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, to evaluate major agency actions, such as the issuance of permits that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Depending on any mitigation strategies recommended in such environmental assessments or environmental impact statements, we could incur added costs, which could be substantial, and be subject to delays, limitations or prohibitions in the scope of crude oil and natural gas projects or performance of midstream services. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt our or our customers E&P activities. Employee health and safety We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) hazard communication standard, the EPA community right to know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state regulations require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we employed 609 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. From time to time we utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services. Offices As of December 31, 2019, we leased 130,300 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas at 1001 Fannin Street, where our principal offices are located, and sub leased 7,800 square feet of office space in Midland, Texas. The lease for our Houston office expires in March 2029 and the sub lease for our Midland office expires in August 2020. We also own field offices in the North Dakota communities of Williston, Powers Lake, Alexander and Watford City.

Risk Factors Our business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could suffer. The risks described below are not the only 1s facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us. Risks related to the crude oil and natural gas industry and our business A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices, in crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGL prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. The price we receive for our crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for crude oil, natural gas and NGL has been volatile. For example, average daily prices for NYMEX WTI crude oil ranged from a high of $66.24 per barrel to a low of $46.31 per barrel during 2019. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $4.25 per MMBtu to a low of $175 per MMBtu during 2019. Likewise, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have experienced significant declines in realized prices since the fall of 2014. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs; the actions of OPEC; the price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil, natural gas and NGL; political conditions in or affecting other crude oil, natural gas and NGL producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America, China, India and Russia; the level of global crude oil, natural gas and NGL E&P activities; the level of global crude oil, natural gas and NGL inventories; events that impact global market demand, including impacts from global health epidemics and concerns, such as the coronavirus; localized supply and demand fundamentals and regional, domestic and international transportation availability; weather conditions and natural disasters; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and policies, including environmental requirements; speculation as to the future price of crude oil and the speculative trading of crude oil and natural gas futures contracts; stockholder activism or activities by non governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGL and related infrastructure; price and availability of competitors supplies of crude oil, natural gas and NGL; technological advances affecting energy consumption; and the price and availability of alternative fuels. Substantially all of our crude oil and natural gas production is sold to purchasers under short term (less than twelve month) contracts at market based prices, and our NGL production is sold to purchasers under long term (more than twelve month) contracts at market based prices. Low crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability, the present value of our reserves and our ability to develop future reserves. See Our exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our estimated net crude oil and natural gas reserves below. Low crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGL that we can produce economically and may affect our proved reserves. See also The present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves below. 30 Table of Content s Increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business. Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. Changes in any 1 or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned operating results. We may not be able to generate enough cash flows to meet our debt obligations. We expect our earnings and cash flows to vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flows may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flows from operations and to pay our debt obligations. Many of these factors, such as crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. If we do not generate enough cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling assets; reducing or delaying capital investments; seeking to raise additional capital; or refinancing or restructuring our debt. If for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross acceleration or cross default rights between the relevant agreements. In addition, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on our Notes (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources ). If amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facilities or our Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot be certain that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the m1y owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders. Please see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes all contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities. Our Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources ) contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things sell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries; pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our common stock or redeem or repurchase our debt; make investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; create or incur certain liens; make certain acquisitions and investments; redeem or prepay other debt; enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; create unrestricted subsidiaries; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and 31 Table of Content s engage in certain business activities. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Our ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Revolving Credit Facilities, the indentures governing our Senior Notes or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our Revolving Credit Facilities, the indentures governing our Senior Notes or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If an event of default under either of our Revolving Credit Facilities occurs and remains uncured, the lenders under the applicable Revolving Credit Facility would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements. A payment default or an acceleration under our Revolving Credit Facilities could result in an event of default and an acceleration under the indentures for our Notes. If the indebtedness under the Notes were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness in full. In addition, our obligations under the Oasis Credit Facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our oil and gas assets, including mortgage liens on oil and gas properties having at least 90% of the reserve value as determined by reserve reports, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the Oasis Credit Facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets. OMP obligations under the OMP Credit Facility are collateralized by mortgages and other security interests on substantially all of OMP and its subsidiaries properties and assets, including the equity interests in all present and future subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions). Some or all of the collateral owned by Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo is subject to an intercreditor agreement between Wells Fargo, National Association ( Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent for the OMP Credit Facility, and Wells Fargo as the administrative agent for the Oasis Credit Facility, and acknowledged by OMS, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo. If OMP is unable to repay its indebtedness under the OMP Credit Facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on OMP assets. However, there are no cross default rights between the Revolving Credit Facilities. Therefore, an acceleration of the OMP Credit Facility will not trigger automatically an acceleration of the Oasis Credit Facility. Please see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2019, we had $337.0 million of outstanding borrowings and had $15.1 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Oasis Credit Facility, $458.5 million of outstanding borrowings and had $17 million of outstanding letters of credit under the OMP Credit Facility, $8627 million available for future secured borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities and $1,9826 million outstanding in Notes.

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Senior unsecured convertible notes. In the future, we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness; a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments; our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; 32 Table of Content s a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing; a high level of debt may make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then outstanding bank borrowings; and a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes. A high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital, and borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In addition, the Oasis Credit Facility borrowing base is subject to periodic redeterminations. We could be forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings under the Oasis Credit Facility due to redeterminations of our borrowing base. If we are forced to do so, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income. To achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, we currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production, including collars and fixed price swaps. We have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments. Derivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments; the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations; or there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual price received. In addition, some of these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for crude oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements. Drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our crude oil and natural gas E&P activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see Our estimated net proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. These levels of uncertainty may be increased with respect to our recently acquired positions in the Delaware Basin due to our inexperience operating in the area. See The Permian Basin Acquisition in 2018 represented our initial expansion outside of the Williston Basin, and we may encounter new obstacles operating in different geographic regions below. Overruns in planned expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel; facility or equipment malfunctions and or failure; 33 Table of Content s unexpected operational events, including accidents; pressure or irregularities in geological formations; adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards, ice storms and floods; reductions in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices; delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities; title problems; and limitations in the market for crude oil and natural gas. Our estimated net proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Item 1 Business Our operations exploration and production activities for information about our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves and the PV 10 and Standardized Measure of discounted future net revenues as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. In order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by our independent reserve engineers, estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition, we may adjust estimates of net proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the limited production history of our undeveloped acreage, the estimates of future production associated with such properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history. The present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. You should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated net crude oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from our estimated net proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net revenues from our oil and gas properties will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for crude oil and natural gas; actual cost of development and production expenditures; the amount and timing of actual production; and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. The timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from estimated net proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our estimated net proved reserves. 34 Table of Content s If crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, we may be required to take write downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. We review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. In addition, we assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property by property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results or future plans to develop acreage. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which may result in a decrease in the amount available under our Revolving Credit Facilities. A write down constitutes a non cash charge to earnings. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices may cause us to incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facilities and our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. Due to the volatility of expected future crude oil prices, we reviewed our proved oil and gas properties for impairment as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, no impairment was recorded on our proved oil and gas properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $3834 million to adjust the carrying value of certain non strategic proved and unproved oil and gas properties held for sale to their estimated fair value, determined based on the expected sales price less costs to sell. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded non cash impairment charges of $5.4 million, $0.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, on our unproved properties due to expiring leases, periodic assessments and drilling plan uncertainty on certain acreage of our unproved properties. The unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services or the unavailability of sufficient transportation for our production could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis. Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services or the unavailability of sufficient transportation for our production could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, compliance with new or emerging legal requirements that affect midstream operations in North Dakota or Texas may reduce the availability of transportation for our production. For example, the NDIC adopted regulations in late 2013 that impose more rigorous pipeline development standards on midstream operators, some of whom we rely on to construct and operate pipeline infrastructure to transport the crude oil and natural gas we produce. Part of our strategic tactics involve drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned drilling in these plays are subject to drilling and completion technique risks and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, we may incur material write downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. Our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling z1, staying in the desired drilling z1 while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage and successfully protecting nearby producing wells from the impact of fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise, and or crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. We could incur material write downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future. 35 Table of Content s Our exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our estimated net crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our exploration and development activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Excluding acquisitions of $210 million in 2019 and $9519 million in 2018, we spent $8224 million and $1,2516 million related to capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our total capital expenditure plan for 2020 is approximately $685 million to $715 million, which includes approximately $575 million to $595 million for E&P and other capital expenditures, including approximately $316 million to $387 million focused in the Williston Basin and approximately $201 million to $268 million focused in the Delaware Basin (with approximately 80 90% of the E&P capital allocated to drilling and completions). Other capital expenditures includes administrative capital, and excludes capitalized interest of approximately $125 million. Since our initial public offering, our capital expenditures have been financed with proceeds from public equity offerings, proceeds from our issuance of senior notes, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, net cash provided by operating activities, the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties and cash settlements of derivative contracts. DeGolyer and MacNaughton projects that we will incur capital costs of $1,375.0 million over the next five years to develop the proved undeveloped reserves in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin covered by its December 31, 2019 reserve report. Additionally, OMP will continue to invest in midstream assets to support our E&P business segment as well as third party customers. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A significant increase in product prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities and cash settlements of derivative contracts; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities or the sale of non strategic assets. The issuance of additional debt or equity may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock. In addition, upon the issuance of certain debt securities (other than on a borrowing base redetermination date), our borrowing base under the Oasis Credit Facility will be automatically reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the aggregate principal amount of such debt securities. Our cash flows provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including our estimated net proved reserves; the level of crude oil, natural gas and NGL we are able to produce from existing wells and new projected wells; the prices at which our crude oil, natural gas and NGL are sold; the costs of developing and producing our crude oil and natural gas production; our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; the ability and willingness of our banks to lend; and our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets. If the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facilities or our revenues decrease as a result of low crude oil, natural gas or NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or cash available under our Revolving Credit Facilities is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our drilling locations, which in turn could lead to a possible expiration of our leases and a decline in our estimated net proved reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will not be the operator on all of our drilling locations, and, therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non operated assets. We may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future drilling locations that result in a greater proportion of our locations being operated by others. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners. Dependence on the operator could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those locations. The success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including 36 Table of Content s the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the operator expertise and financial resources; approval of other participants in drilling wells; selection of technology; and the rate of production of reserves, if any. This limited ability to exercise control over the operations of some of our drilling locations may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. All of our producing properties and operations are located in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin regions, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating among a limited number of geographic areas. As of December 31, 2019, 92% of our production was located in the Williston Basin in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana and the remaining 8% of our production was located in the Delaware Basin in west Texas. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of economics in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin or delays or interruptions of production from those wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of crude oil or natural gas produced from the wells in those areas. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic crude oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Permian Basin Acquisition in 2018 represented our initial expansion outside of the Williston Basin, and we may encounter new obstacles operating in different geographic regions. Our operations have historically focused on a single geographic region, namely the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin. The Permian Basin Acquisition represents our initial entry into the Delaware Basin, and our first expansion of our operations outside of the Williston Basin. Certain aspects related to operating in the Delaware Basin may not be as familiar to us as our Williston Basin project areas. As a result, we may encounter obstacles that may cause us not to achieve the expected results of the Permian Basin Acquisition and subsequent bolt on acquisitions. These obstacles may include a less familiar geological landscape, different completion techniques, midstream and downstream operators with whom we have no established relationship, greater competition for acreage, unfamiliar operating conditions and a distinct regulatory environment. Any adverse conditions, regulations or developments related to our expansion into the Delaware Basin may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business depends on crude oil and natural gas gathering and transportation facilities, some of which are owned by third parties. The marketability of our crude oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by midstream operators, including third parties and by OMP. The unavailability of, or lack of, available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells, the flaring of natural gas that could result in restrictions on production or m1tary sanctions, or the delay, or discontinuance of, development plans for properties. See also Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs markets or delay our production and Insufficient transportation, end market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices below. The transportation of our production can be interrupted by other customers that have firm arrangements. In addition, these midstream operators may also impose specifications for the products that they are willing to accept. If the total mix of a product fails to meet the applicable product quality specifications, the midstream operators may refuse to accept all or a part of the products or may invoice us for the costs to handle or damages from receiving the out of specification products. In those circumstances, we may be required to delay the delivery of or find alternative markets for that product, or shut in the producing wells that are causing the products to be out of specification, potentially reducing our revenues. The disruption of midstream operators facilities due to maintenance, weather or other interruptions of service could also negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored. A total shut in of our production could materially affect us due to a resulting lack of cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent 37 Table of Content s sufficient cash flows. Potential crude oil or NGL train derailments or crashes as well as state or federal restrictions on the vapor pressure of crude oil transported by, or loaded on or unloaded from, railcars could also impact our ability to market and deliver our products and cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices due to tighter safety regulations imposed on crude by rail transportation and interruptions in service. Insufficient transportation, end market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized crude oil and natural gas prices. The crude oil business environment has historically been characterized by periods when crude oil production has surpassed local transportation and refining capacity, resulting in substantial discounts in the price received for crude oil versus prices quoted for NYMEX WTI crude oil. In the past, there have been periods when this discount has substantially increased due to the production of crude oil in the area increasing to a point that it temporarily surpasses the available pipeline transportation, rail transportation and refining capacity in the area. Expansions of both rail and pipeline facilities have reduced the prior constraint on crude oil transportation out of the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin and improved basin differentials received at the lease. On barrels that we transport and sell outside of the basins, our realized price for crude oil is generally the quoted price at the point of sale less transportation costs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, as production increased and existing pipelines in the Williston Basin were again running at peak rates, rail transportation increased and our Williston Basin price differentials relative to NYMEX WTI widened to more than $350 per barrel below NYMEX WTI. In the first half of 2019, our Delaware Basin price differentials relative to NYMEX WTI weakened due to transportation capacity restraints, averaging more than $5.00 per barrel below NYMEX WTI. However, expansions of pipelines began to occur in mid 2019 which greatly reduced these differentials, which became positive to NYMEX WTI by year end. Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs markets or delay our production. Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory crude oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of crude oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by midstream operators. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity. If our production becomes shut in for any of these or other reasons, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market. Our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold in a limited number of geographic markets so an oversupply in any of those areas could have a material negative effect on the price we receive. Our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold in a limited number of geographic markets and each has a generally fixed amount of storage and processing capacity. As a result, if such markets become oversupplied with crude oil, natural gas and or NGLs, it could have a material negative effect on the prices we receive for our products and therefore an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Variances in quality may also cause differences in the value received for our products. Additionally, the refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast is insufficient to refine all of the light sweet crude oil being produced in the United States. The United States imports heavy crude oil and exports light crude oil to utilize the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries that have more heavy refining capacity. If light sweet crude oil production remains at current levels or continues to increase, demand for our light crude oil production could result in widening price discounts to the world crude prices and potential shut in or reduction of production due to a lack of sufficient markets despite the lift on prior restrictions on the exporting of crude oil and natural gas from the United States. The development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the Williston Basin, Delaware Basin and other areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced. Approximately 42% of our estimated net proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2019. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. The future development of our proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts as well as access to liquidity sources, such as capital markets, our Revolving Credit Facilities and derivative contracts. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV 10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves. 38 Table of Content s Unless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks. We are not insured against all risks. Additionally, certain of our insurance policies also provide coverage to OMP and as a result, a claim by OMP against 1 of our shared insurance policies may reduce the remaining amount of coverage available to us. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our crude oil and natural gas E&P activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas, including the possibility of environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, c rude oil and produced water spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gas, such as hydrogen sulfide, or other pollutants into the environment; abnormally pressured formations; shortages of, or delays in, obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities; mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing failure; personal injuries and death; and natural disasters. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of injury or loss of life; damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution and other environmental damage; regulatory investigations and penalties; suspension of our operations; and repair and remediation costs. Insurance against all operational risk is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Also, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have incurred losses in 2019 and prior years and may do so again in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred a net loss of $128.2 million and $35.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a pre tax loss of $75.9 million, but had a positive net income after taxes primarily due to the income tax benefit related to the tax rate change under the Tax Act. Our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures, including planned capital expenditures for 2020 of approximately $685 million to $715 million. The uncertainty and risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10 K may impede our ability to economically find, develop, exploit and acquire crude oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future. 39 Table of Content s Drilling locations that we decide to drill may not yield crude oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location which is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield crude oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether crude oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether crude oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of crude oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin may not be indicative of future or long term production rates. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive. Our potential drilling location inventories are scheduled to be drilled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our potential drilling locations. Our management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These potential drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our execution strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, crude oil and natural gas prices, costs and drilling results. These levels of uncertainty may be increased with respect to our recently acquired positions in the Delaware Basin due to our inexperience operating in the area. See The Permian Basin Acquisition in 2018 represented our initial expansion outside of the Williston Basin, and we may encounter new obstacles operating in different geographic regions above. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. Pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. These rules and guidance may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage, the primary term is extended through continuous drilling provisions or the leases are renewed. In the highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 97% and 71% of our total net acreage in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, respectively, was held by production. The leases for our net acreage not held by production will expire at the end of their primary term unless production is established in paying quantities under the units containing these leases, the leases are held beyond their primary terms under continuous drilling provisions or the leases are renewed. In the Williston Basin, our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within 3 to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. In the Delaware Basin, our acreage must be drilled before lease or term assignment expiration and, in some leases, must be further perpetuated via additional drilling activity to satisfy continuous drilling and development provisions. Additionally, certain leases and term assignments in the Delaware Basin require development at various depths in order to perpetuate our ownership as to those depths. As of December 31, 2019, we had 8,809 net acres expiring in 2020, 2,536 net acres expiring in 2021 and 797 net acres expiring in 2022 in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, on certain portions of our acreage, third party leases become immediately effective if our leases expire. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded non cash impairment charges of $5.4 million, $0.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, on our unproved properties due to expiring leases, periodic assessments and drilling plan uncertainty on certain acreage of our unproved properties. 40 Table of Content s Our operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. Our crude oil and natural gas E&P operations, midstream operations, well servicing operations and related operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations and services including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling, providing midstream services or other regulated activities; the restriction on types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and OSHA, and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which may cause us to incur significant capital or operating expenditures or costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations in affected areas. Our operations risk incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled or processing facilities or pipelines are located and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damage. In addition, accidental spills or other releases could expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in delayed, restricted or more stringent or costly well drilling, plant or pipeline construction, completion or water management activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the NAAQS for ground level oz1 to 70 parts per billion for the 8 hour primary and secondary oz1 standards. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground level oz1 and has issued final requirements that apply to state, local and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS. State implementation of these revised NAAQS standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with any of these rules or any other new or amended legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Failure to comply with federal, state and local laws could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport our crude oil and natural gas and may result in substantial penalties. Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations, particularly as they relate to the regulation of crude oil and natural gas production and transportation. These laws and regulations include regulation of crude oil and natural gas E&P and related operations, including a variety of activities related to the drilling of wells, and the interstate transportation of crude oil and natural gas by federal agencies such as FERC, as well as state agencies. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. Due to recent incidents involving the release of crude oil and natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in the United States, there have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels to restrict crude oil and natural gas drilling operations in certain locations. Any increased regulation or suspension of crude oil and natural gas exploration and production, or revision or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, that arise out of these incidents or otherwise could result in delays and higher operating costs. Such costs or significant delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the lesser extent we are a shipper on interstate pipelines, we must comply with the FERC approved tariffs of such pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity. 41 Table of Content s Should we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of FERC, the CFTC or the FTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. In addition, federal laws prohibit market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil and or natural gas. Failure to comply with federal, state and local laws could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport our crude oil and natural gas and may result in substantial penalties. Please see Item 1 Business Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry. Our business involves the selling and shipping by rail of crude oil and NGLs, including from the Bakken shale, which involves risks of derailment, accidents and liabilities associated with cleanup and damages, as well as potential regulatory changes that may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. A portion of our crude oil and NGL production is transported to market centers by rail. Past derailments in North America of trains transporting crude oil have caused various regulatory agencies and industry organizations, as well as federal, state and municipal governments, to focus attention on transportation by rail of flammable materials. Transportation safety regulators in the United States and Canada are concerned that crude oil from the Bakken shale may be more flammable than crude oil from other producing regions and have made or are considering changes to existing regulations to address those possible risks. In 2015, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, additional requirements to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol, a classification and testing program for crude oil, new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids, and a requirement that older DOT 111 tank cars be phased out by as early as January 1, 2018 if they are not already retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards. In 2016, PHMSA released a final rule mandating a phase out schedule for all DOT 111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029 and more recently in February 2019, PHMSA published a final rule requiring railroads to develop and submit comprehensive crude oil spill response plans for specific route segments traveled by a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train. Additionally, the February 2019 final rule requires railroads to establish geographic response z1s along various rail routes, ensure that both personnel and equipment are staged and prepared to respond in the event of an accident, and share information about high hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions. In addition to these or other actions taken or proposed by federal agencies, a number of states proposed or enacted laws in recent years that encourage safer rail operations, urge the federal government to strengthen requirements for these operations or otherwise seek to impose more stringent standards on crude oil being transported by rail. For example, in the absence of a current federal standard on the vapor pressure of crude oil transported by rail, the State of Washington passed a law that became effective on July 28, 2019, prohibiting the loading or unloading of crude oil from a rail car in the state unless the crude oil vapor pressure is lower than nine pounds per square inch. In response, the States of North Dakota and Montana filed a preemption application with PHMSA in July 2019, in which the states seek to have PHMSA make an administrative determination and override the Washington State vapor pressure limits. In July 2019, PHMSA published an invitation for public comments on the preemption application, which comment period closed in the latter half of 2019, with no administrative determination yet being released. Efforts are likewise underway in Canada to assess and address risks from the transport of crude oil by rail. For example, in 2014, Transport Canada issued a protective order prohibiting crude oil shippers from using 5,000 of the DOT 111 tank cars and imposing a 3 year phase out period for approximately 65,000 tank cars that do not meet certain safety requirements. Transport Canada also imposed a 50 mile per hour speed limit on trains carrying hazardous materials and required all crude oil shipments in Canada to have an emergency response plan. At the same time that PHMSA released its 2015 rule, Canada Minister of Transport announced Canada new tank car standards, which largely align with the requirements in the PHMSA rule. Likewise, Transport Canada rail car retrofitting and phase out timeline largely aligns with the timeline introduced under the 2015 and 2016 PHMSA rules. Transport Canada has also introduced new requirements that railways carry minimum levels of insurance depending on the quantity of crude oil or dangerous goods that they transport as well as a final report recommending additional practices for the transportation of dangerous goods. Both Transport Canada and PHMSA issued final rules in 2018 that further harmonize their respective tank car standards, including with respect to tank car approvals and design requirements. New laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement regarding hazardous material transportation may occur in the future, which could directly and indirectly increase our operation, compliance and transportation costs and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with standards and regulations emerging from these existing and any future rulemakings will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we may incur significant constraints on transportation capacity during the period while tank cars are being retrofitted or newly constructed to comply with the new regulations. In addition, any derailment of crude oil or NGLs from the Bakken shale involving crude oil or NGLs that we have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities. 42 Table of Content s Although we believe that we are adequately insured against such events, we cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover the entirety of any damages that may arise from such events. Our E&P and midstream operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of concerns regarding the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs and costs of compliance, limit the areas in which crude oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce or provide midstream services for while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production or midstream services and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement NSPS directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the crude oil and natural gas sector, and together with the United States Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations sponsored Paris Agreement, which is a non binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020. Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in federal political risks in the United States in the form of pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Critical declarations made by 1 or more presidential candidates include proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of crude oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions to crude oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities, as well as the rescission of the United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, prop1nts of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax, which 1 or more developments could have an adverse effect on our or our customers business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for crude oil and natural gas, which could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we or our customer produce and lower the value of our reserves as well as reduce demand for our midstream and well services. Additionally, political, financial and litigation risks may result in us and our customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as 43 Table of Content s a result of climatic changes, or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our midstream services. 1 or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate related damages to our facilities, our costs of operations potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non routine operating practices necessitated by such climate effects, or increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations. Federal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect the drilling program production of crude oil and natural gas. Operations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non producing subsurface formations. These injection wells are regulated pursuant to the UIC program established under the SDWA. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of produced water from crude oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such injection wells. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas as being among six states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or crude oil and natural gas extraction. Since that time, the United States Geological Survey indicates that these rates have decreased in these six states, although concern continues to exist over quakes arising from induced seismic activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in Texas, the RRC has adopted rules governing the permitting or re permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of crude oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or our customers. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in operational activities, our or our customers costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production or conduct midstream services or dispose of produced water may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of crude oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into the targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or conducted investigations over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority under the SDWA over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities, as well as published an ANPR regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing; issued final CAA regulations that include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and new emissions standards for methane from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the crude oil and natural gas source category; and published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional crude oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM decision to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in federal district court. Also, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, 44 Table of Content s concluding that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. In addition, from time to time Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. However, the threat of climate change has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate related pledges to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells being made by certain candidates seeking the office of President of the United States in 2020. At the state level, some states, including North Dakota and Texas where we primarily operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to adopt certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, crude oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Any, new or more stringent legal restrictions or bans relating to hydraulic fracturing adopted in areas where we operate, or in the future plan to operate, could also lead to delays in, or restriction or cancellation of, our or our customers operations, result in increased operating costs in our or our customers production of crude oil and natural gas, potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new crude oil and natural gas wells and perhaps even be limited or precluded from drilling wells or in the volume that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations with respect to E&P activities and midstream and well services. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks. Operations using hydraulic fracturing are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water for E&P activities and the disposal of flowback and produced water may impact operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Water is an essential comp1nt of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. The occurrence of these or similar developments may result in limitations being placed on allocations of water due to needs by third party businesses with more senior contractual or permitting rights to the water. Our inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact our E&P operations or midstream and well services and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental regulations and other regulatory initiatives could include increased restrictions on our or our customers ability to dispose of flowback and produced water generated in hydraulic fracturing or other fluids resulting from E&P activities. Applicable laws, including the Clean Water Act, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and require that permits or other approvals be obtained to discharge pollutants to such waters. For example, in 2015, the EPA and the Corps under the Obama Administration issued a final rule outlining their position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. In 2017, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, in October 2019, the agencies published a final rule made effective on December 23, 2019, rescinding the 2015 rule. On January 23, 2020, the 2 agencies issued a final rule re defining the Clean Water Act jurisdiction over waters of the United States, which redefinition is narrower than found in the 2015 rule. Upon being published in the Federal Register and the passage of 60 days thereafter, the January 23, 2020 final rule will become effective, at which point the United States will be covered under a single regulatory scheme as it relates to federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. However, there remains the expectation that the January 23, 2020 final rule also will be legally challenged in federal district court. Additionally, regulations implemented under the Clean Water Act and similar state laws prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the crude oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of crude oil and hazardous substances. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells and any inability to secure transportation and access to disposal wells with sufficient capacity to accept all of our or our customers flowback and produced water on economic terms may increase our or our customers operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our or our customers operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted but that could be materially adverse to our business and results of operations. 45 Table of Content s Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. Certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the HLPSA with respect to crude oil and condensate and the NGPSA with respect to natural gas. The HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of hazardous liquid and gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increases in governmental enforcement adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. Legislation in recent years has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, which among other things, increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In 2016, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act was passed, extending PHMSA statutory mandate through September 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for gas storage facilities. The 2016 Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued an interim rule in 2016 and published a final rule on October 1, 2019 to implement the agency expanded authority to address such conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment. Because the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized PHMSA hazardous liquid and gas pipeline programs only through September 30, 2019, we anticipate that Congress will issue an updated pipeline safety law in 2020 that will reauthorize those programs through 2023 The adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, on October 1, 2019, PHMSA published a final rule for hazardous liquid transmission and gathering pipelines that becomes effective July 1, 2020 and significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA hazardous liquid pipeline integrity management requirements regardless of the pipeline proximity to a HCA (for example, integrity assessments at least once every 10 years of onshore, piggable, hazardous liquid pipeline segments located outside of HCAs, and expanded use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated hazardous liquid pipelines other than offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines). The final rule also requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting a HCA to be capable of accommodating in line inspection tools within the next 20 years unless the basic construction of a pipeline cannot be modified to permit that accommodation. Also, this final rule extends annual, accident, and safety related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and also imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure. In a second example, in 2016, PHMSA announced a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines in newly defined MCAs that contain as few as five dwellings within a potential impact area; requiring natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus excluded from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their MAOP; and requiring certain onshore and offshore gathering lines in Class I areas to comply with damage prevention, corrosion control, public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning standards. Additional requirements proposed by this proposed rulemaking would increase PHMSA integrity management requirements for gas pipelines and also require consideration of seismicity in evaluating threats to pipelines. PHMSA has since decided to split its 2016 proposed rule, which has become known as the gas mega rule, into 3 separate rulemaking proceedings to facilitate completion. The first of these 3 rulemakings, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, was published as a final rule on October 1, 2019, becomes effective on July 1, 2020, and imposes numerous requirements on such pipelines, including MAOP reconfirmation, the assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (including all MCAs and those Class 3 and Class 4 areas found not to be in HCAs) within 14 years of publication date and at least once every 10 years thereafter, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of 46 Table of Content s seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. The remaining rulemakings comprising the gas mega rule are expected to be issued in 2020. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines. We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and associated facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations. We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and associated facilities have been constructed, and we are, therefore, subject to the possibility of more 1rous terms and or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights of way or if such rights of way lapse or terminate. We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Additionally, the federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, has held that tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at 1 time owned by an individual Indian landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline rights of way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators. We cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights of way or obtain new rights of way without experiencing significant costs. Any loss of rights with respect to our real property, through our inability to renew right of way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and ability to make cash distributions to the unitholders of OMP. Competition in the crude oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel. Our ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure equipment and trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory drilling locations or to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of unsuccessful drilling attempts, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining qualified personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations. To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel, including Thomas B. Nusz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Taylor L. Reid, our President and Chief Operating Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. Seasonal weather conditions adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate. Crude oil and natural gas operations in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. In the Williston Basin, drilling and other crude oil and natural gas activities cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months. Severe winter weather conditions limit and may temporarily halt our ability to operate during such conditions. Results of operations in the Delaware Basin may also be negatively affected by inclement weather during the winter months to a lesser extent. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. The inability of 1 or more of our customers or affiliates to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results. Our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production ($276.6 million in receivables at December 31, 2019), which we market to energy marketing companies, other producers, 47 Table of Content s power generators, local distribution companies, refineries and affiliates and joint interest receivables ($821 million at December 31, 2019). We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our crude oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Phillips 66 Company accounted for approximately 14% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment. For the year ended 2018, no purchaser accounted for more than 10% of the Company total sales from the exploration and production segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 16% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total sales from the exploration and production segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017. We do not require all of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we choose to drill. We have limited ability to control participation in our wells. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $0.2 million in bad debt expense as a result of our assessment that it is probable certain receivables may not be collected. In addition, our crude oil and natural gas derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis, as all counterparty contracts provide for net settlement. At December 31, 2019, we had derivatives in place with nine counterparties and a total net derivative liability of $18.6 million. We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves, well performance and potential liabilities, as well as uncertainties in forecasting crude oil and natural gas prices and future development, production and marketing costs, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategic tactics. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves; future crude oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials; development and operating costs; potential for future drilling and production; validity of the seller title to the properties, which may be less than expected at the time of signing the purchase agreement; and potential environmental and other liabilities, together with associated litigation of such matters. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an as is basis. Indemnification from the sellers will generally be effective only during a limited time period after the closing and subject to certain dollar limitations and minimums. We may not be able to collect on such indemnification because of disputes with the sellers or their inability to pay. Moreover, there is a risk that we could ultimately be liable for unknown obligations related to acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including diversion of our management attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions; the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of our operations while carrying on our ongoing business; difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations; 48 Table of Content s an inability to secure, on acceptable terms, sufficient financing that may be required in connection with expanded operations and unknown liabilities; and the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations. The process of integrating assets could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. The success of an acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours. Even if we successfully integrate the assets acquired, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices, in crude oil and natural gas industry conditions, by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations, failure to retain key personnel, an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected. We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest. It is our practice in acquiring crude oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of crude oil and natural gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. Prior to the drilling of a crude oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in the title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be d1 to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. There is no assurance that we will not suffer a m1tary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss. The enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the negative effect of commodity price changes, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. On July 21, 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act ), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Dodd Frank Act, the CFTC has proposed new regulations to set position limits for certain futures, options and swap contracts in designated physical commodities, including, among others, crude oil and natural gas. The Dodd Frank Act and CFTC rules have also designated certain types of swaps (thus far, only certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps) for mandatory clearing and exchange trading, and may designate other types of swaps for mandatory clearing and exchange trading in the future. To the extent that we engage in such transactions or transactions that become subject to such rules in the future, we will be required to comply with the clearing and exchange trading requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the non financial end user exception from margin requirements for swaps to other market participants, such as swap dealers, these rules may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the non financial end user exception, we could be required to post initial or variation margin, which would impact liquidity and reduce our cash. This would in turn reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows. Other regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd Frank Act also remain to be finalized. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Dodd Frank Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects. The Dodd Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to m1tize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less credi2rthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Further, to the extent our revenues are unhedged, they could be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these 49 Table of Content s consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the European Union and other non U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. We may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating losses ( NOLs ) to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal or state tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, we had significant federal and state income tax NOLs, which will begin to expire in 2030 and 2020 for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( Section 382 ), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has underg1 an ownership change. Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. We may in the future undergo an ownership change under Section 382 If an ownership change occurs in the future, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. An unfavorable resolution of the Mirada Litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. On March 23, 2017, Mirada (as defined in Item 3 Legal Proceedings ) filed a lawsuit against Oasis Petroleum Inc., OPNA and OMS in the 334th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. Mirada asserts that it is a working interest owner in certain acreage owned and operated by us and that we have breached certain agreements by (1) failing to allow Mirada to participate in the Company midstream operations in Wild Basin; (2) refusing to provide Mirada with information that Mirada contends is required under certain agreements and failing to provide information in a timely fashion; (3) failing to consult with Mirada and failing to obtain Mirada consent prior to drilling more than 1 well at a time in Wild Basin; and (4) overstating the estimated costs of proposed well operations in Wild Basin. Mirada seeks a declaratory judgment that the Company be removed as operator in Wild Basin at Mirada election and that Mirada be allowed to elect a new operator; certain agreements apply to the Company and Mirada and Wild Basin with respect to this dispute; the Company be required to provide all information within its possession regarding proposed or ongoing operations in Wild Basin; and the Company not be permitted to drill, or propose to drill, more than 1 well at a time in Wild Basin without obtaining Mirada consent. Mirada also seeks a declaratory judgment with respect to the Company current midstream operations in Wild Basin. Specifically, Mirada seeks a declaratory judgment that Mirada has a right to participate in the Company Wild Basin midstream operations, consisting of produced water disposal, crude oil gathering and natural gas gathering and processing; that, upon Mirada election to participate, Mirada is obligated to pay its proportionate costs of the Company midstream operations in Wild Basin; and that Mirada would then be entitled to receive a share of revenues from the midstream operations and would not be charged any amount for its use of these facilities for production from the Contract Area. On June 30, 2017, Mirada amended its original petition to add a claim that we have breached certain agreements by charging Mirada for midstream services provided by its affiliates and to seek a declaratory judgment that Mirada is entitled to be paid its share of total proceeds from the sale of hydrocarbons received by OPNA or any affiliate of OPNA without deductions for midstream services provided by OPNA or its affiliates. On February 2, 2018 and February 16, 2018, Mirada filed a second and third amended petition, respectively. In these filings, Mirada alleged new legal theories for being entitled to enforce the underlying contracts and added Bighorn DevCo, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo as defendants, asserting that these entities were created in bad faith in an effort to avoid contractual obligations owed to Mirada. On March 2, 2018, Mirada filed a fourth amended petition that described Mirada alleged ownership and assignment of interests in assets purportedly governed by agreements at issue in the lawsuit. On August 31, 2018, Mirada filed a fifth amended petition that added OMP as a defendant, asserting that it was created in bad faith in an effort to avoid contractual obligations owed to Mirada. On July 2, 2019, Oasis, OPNA, OMS, OMP, Bighorn DevCo, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo (collectively Oasis Entities ) counterclaimed against Mirada for a judgment declaring that Oasis Entities are not obligated to purchase, manage, gather, transport, compress, process, market, sell or otherwise handle Mirada proportionate share of c rude oil and gas produced from OPNA operated wells. The counterclaim also seeks attorney fees, costs and expenses. On November 1, 2019, Mirada filed a sixth amended petition that stated that Mirada seeks in excess of $200 million in damages and asserted that OMS is an agent of OPNA and that OPNA, OMS, OMP, Bighorn DevCo, Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo are agents of Oasis. Mirada also changed its allegation that it may elect a new operator for the subject wells to instead allege that Mirada may remove OPNA as operator. On November 1, 2019, the Oasis Entities amended their counterclaim against Mirada to include a request for a judgment declaring that a provision in 1 of the agreements does not incorporate by reference any provisions in a certain participation 50 Table of Content s agreement and joint operating agreement. The additional counterclaim also seeks attorney fees, costs and expenses. On the same day, the Oasis Entities filed an amended answer asserting additional defenses against Mirada claims. Mirada may further amend its petition from time to time to assert additional claims as well as defendants. Discovery is ongoing, and each of the parties has made a number of procedural filings and motions, and additional filings and motions can be expected over the course of the claim. Trial is scheduled for May 2020. For further information regarding this lawsuit, please read Item 3 Legal Proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of the Mirada Litigation or the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuit. If such litigation were to be determined adversely to our interests, or if we were forced to settle such matter for a significant amount, such resolution or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such an adverse determination could materially impact our ability to operate our properties in Wild Basin or develop our identified drilling locations in Wild Basin on our current development schedule. A determination that Mirada has a right to participate in our midstream operations could materially reduce the interests of us in our current assets and future midstream opportunities and related revenues in Wild Basin. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify OMP for any losses resulting from this litigation under the omnibus agreement we entered into with OMP at the time of its initial public offering. We are from time to time involved in legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities. Like other similarly situated oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, claims from royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury claims, regulatory compliance matters, disputes with tax authorities and other matters. The outcome of such matters often cannot be predicted with certainty. If our efforts to defend ourselves in legal, governmental and regulatory matters are not successful, it is possible the outcome of 1 or more such proceedings could result in substantial liability, penalties, sanctions, judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals related to legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings could change from period to period, and such changes could be material. Disputes or uncertainties may arise in relation to our royalty obligations. Our production is subject to royalty obligations which may be prescribed by government regulation or by contract. These royalty obligations may be subject to changes in interpretation as business circumstances change and the law in jurisdictions in which we operate continues to evolve. For example, the Supreme Court of North Dakota recently issued an opinion indicating a change in its interpretation of how certain gas royalty payments are calculated under North Dakota law with respect to certain state leases, the impacts of which are still unclear. Such changes in interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such changes in interpretation could result in legal or other proceedings. Please see We are from time to time involved in legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities for a discussion of risks related to such proceedings. Terrorist attacks or cyber attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Terrorist attacks or cyber attacks may significantly affect the energy industry, including our operations and those of our potential customers, as well as general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity. Strategic targets, such as energy related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. Also, destructive forms of protests and opposition by extremists and other disruptions, including acts of sabotage or eco terrorism, against crude oil and natural gas development and production or midstream processing or transportation activities could potentially result in damage or injury to persons, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and or financial loss. The crude oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day to day operations, including certain midstream activities. For example, software programs are used to manage gathering and transportation systems and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as crude oil and natural gas pipelines. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data and to communicate with our employees and business partners. Our business partners, including 51 Table of Content s vendors, service providers and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct midstream activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation. As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems or data for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. SCADA based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks due to their critical role in operations. Our technologies, systems, ne2rks and data, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as unauthorized surveillance or a cyber breach, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our information systems or data and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, including any vendor or service provider, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt development of additional infrastructure, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project; delays in delivering or failure to deliver product at the tailgate of our facilities, resulting in a loss of revenues; operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues; events of non compliance that could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and business interruptions that could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on the price of our units. Our implementation of various controls and processes, including globally incorporating a risk based cyber security framework, to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Ineffective internal controls could impact our business and financial results. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and financial results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock We do not intend to pay, and we are currently prohibited from paying, dividends on our common stock and, consequently, our shareholders only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment is if the price of our stock appreciates. We do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we are currently restricted from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our Revolving Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. Consequently, our shareholders only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates, which may not occur, and the shareholder sells their shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock will ever exceed the price that the shareholder paid. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including a classified Board of Directors, so that only approximately 1 third of our directors are elected each year; 52 Table of Content s limitations on the removal of directors; and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board of Directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders. Delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of 3 years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our Board of Directors. Conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the market price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the Senior Convertible Notes (as defined in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources ) may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Senior Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, and anticipated conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.
