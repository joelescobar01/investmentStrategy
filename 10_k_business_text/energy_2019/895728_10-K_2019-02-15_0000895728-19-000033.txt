Refer to SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 31 The likelihood of having to perform under these guarantees and indemnifications is largely dependent upon future operations of various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. We cannot reasonably estimate the total maximum potential amounts that could become payable to third parties and affiliates under such agreements described above; however, historically, we have not made any significant payments under guarantee or indemnification provisions. While these agreements may specify a maximum potential exposure, or a specified duration to the guarantee or indemnification obligation, there are circumstances where the amount and duration are unlimited. The guarantees and indemnifications have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, earnings, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. and construction contracts and leases. We typically enter into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. 189 We may also be a party to agreements with subsidiaries, jointly owned entities, unconsolidated entities such as equity method investees, or entities with other ownership arrangements that require us to provide financial and performance guarantees. Financial guarantees include stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. To varying degrees, these guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not included on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Performance guarantees require us to make payments to a third party if the guaranteed affiliate entity does not perform on its contractual obligations, such as debt agreements, purchase or sale agreements, In the normal course of conducting business, we enter into agreements which indemnify third parties and affiliates. Examples include indemnifying counterparties pursuant to sale agreements for assets or businesses in matters such as breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, loss or damages to property, environmental liabilities, and litigation and contingent liabilities. We may indemnify third parties for certain liabilities relating to environmental matters arising from operations prior to the purchase or transfer of certain assets and interests. Similarly, we may indemnify the purchaser of assets for certain tax liabilities incurred while we owned the assets, a misrepresentation related to taxes that result in a loss to the purchaser or other certain tax liabilities related to those assets. GUARANTEES 30. We are subject to various other legal and regulatory actions and proceedings which arise in the normal course of business, including interventions in regulatory proceedings and challenges to regulatory approvals and permits by special interest groups. While the final outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of such actions and proceedings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. OTHER LITIGATION We and our subsidiaries maintain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. While fully supportable in our view, these tax positions, if challenged by tax authorities, may not be fully sustained on review. TAX MATTERS On October 14, 2016, an amended claim was filed against Aux Sable by a counterparty to an NGL supply agreement. On January 5, 2017, Aux Sable filed a Statement of Defence with respect to this claim. While the final outcome of this action cannot be predicted with certainty, at this time management believes that the ultimate resolution of this action will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2014, Aux Sable US received a Notice and Finding of Violation (NFOV) from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act related to the Leak Detection and Repair program, and related provisions of the Clean Air Act permit for Aux Sable Channahon, Illinois facility. As part of the ongoing process of responding to the September 2014 NFOV, Aux Sable discovered what it believed to be an exceedance of currently permitted limits for Volatile Organic Material. In April 2015, a second NFOV from the EPA was received in connection with this potential exceedance. Aux Sable engaged in discussions with the EPA to evaluate the impacts and ultimate resolution of these issues, including with respect to a draft Consent Decree, and those discussions are continuing. The Consent Decree, which is effective as of December 31, 2018, did not have a material impact. Notice of Violation AUX SABLE impact our operations may have on the environment. To the extent that we are unable to recover payment for environmental liabilities from insurance or other potentially responsible parties, we will be responsible for payment of liabilities arising from environmental incidents associated with the operating activities of our liquids and natural gas businesses. 188 Environmental risk is inherent to liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas pipeline operations, and Enbridge and our affiliates are, at times, subject to environmental remediation at various contaminated sites. We manage this environmental risk through appropriate environmental policies and practices to minimize any We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on us.

For defined contribution plans, benefit costs equal amounts required to be contributed by us. Defined Contribution Plans Benefits payable from the defined benefit plans are based on each plan participant years of service and final average remuneration. These benefits are partially inflation indexed after a plan participant retirement. Our contributions are made in accordance with independent actuarial valuations and are invested primarily in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities. Defined Benefit Plans We maintain registered and non registered, contributory and non contributory pension plans which provide defined benefit and or defined contribution pension benefits covering substantially all employees. The Canadian Plans provide Company funded defined benefit and or defined contribution pension benefits to our Canadian employees. The United States Plans provide Company funded defined benefit pension benefits to our United States employees. We also maintain supplemental pension plans that provide pension benefits in excess of the basic plans for certain employees.

We have recognized these provisional tax impacts and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. $0.2 billion in 2017. We have also adjusted our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets existing at December 31, 2016 for the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate by $11 billion and increased our regulatory liability by $31 billion decrease to our 2017 deferred income tax provision related to the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate. The accounting for these provisional Item decreased our accumulated deferred income tax liability by $20 billion increase to our 2017 current income tax provision related to the toll tax, payable over eight years. We recorded a provisional $34 million In 2017 we made reasonable estimates for the measurement and accounting of certain effects of the TCJA in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118 (SAB 118). Accordingly, we recorded a provisional 177 . In 2017 we were also impacted by a 1 time deemed repatriation or toll tax on undistributed earnings and profits of United States controlled foreign affiliates, including Canadian subsidiaries. 21% to 35% Most changes to the TCJA are effective for taxation years beginning after December 31, 2017. While the changes are broad and complex, the most significant change was the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Base Erosion and Anti abuse Tax (BEAT); and we recorded no provision for the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income Tax (GILTI). $43 million We recorded was recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with rate cases filed that eliminated a portion of regulated liability formerly included in SEP's rate base. $223 million reduction to the overall regulatory liability. An additional reduction to the regulated liability in the amount of $30 million On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2018, we made certain estimates for the measurement and accounting of certain effects of the TCJA for the year ended and as at December 31, 2017. As we continue to gather, prepare and analyze the necessary information in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for the impact of TCJA, we continue to refine our estimates. During the first quarter of 2018 we refined our calculation of the regulatory liability associated with the TCJA which resulted in a United States Tax Reform Enbridge and 1 or more of our subsidiaries are subject to taxation in Canada, the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examinations include the United States (Federal) and Canada (Federal, Alberta and Ontario). We are open to examination by Canadian tax authorities for the 2010 to 2018 tax years and by United States tax authorities for the 2013 to 2018 tax years. We are currently under examination for income tax matters in Canada for the 2013 to 2017 tax years and in the United States for the 2013 to 2014 tax years. We are not currently under examination for income tax matters in any other material jurisdiction where we are subject to income tax. , respectively. If such earnings are remitted, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on such amounts is not practicable. 2017 and December 31, 2018 for the period $21 billion and $5.8 billion We have not provided for deferred income taxes on the difference between the carrying value of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries and their corresponding tax basis as the earnings of those subsidiaries are intended to be permanently reinvested in their operations. As such these investments are not anticipated to give rise to income taxes in the foreseeable future. The difference between the carrying values of the investments and their tax bases is largely a result of unremitted earnings and currency translation adjustments.

When possible, we estimate the fair value of our derivatives based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, we use estimates from third party brokers. For non exchange traded derivatives classified in Levels 2 and 3, we use standard valuation techniques to calculate the estimated fair value. These methods include discounted cash flows for forwards and swaps and Black Scholes Merton pricing models for options. Depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying risk, we use observable market prices (interest, foreign exchange, commodity and share price) and volatility as primary inputs to these valuation techniques. Finally, we consider our own credit default swap spread as well as the credit default swap spreads associated with our counterparties in our estimation of fair value. Level 3 includes derivative valuations based on inputs which are less observable, unavailable or where the observable data does not support a significant portion of the derivatives fair value. Generally, Level 3 derivatives are longer dated transactions, occur in less active markets, occur at locations where pricing information is not available or have no binding broker quote to support Level 2 classification. We have developed methodologies, benchmarked against industry standards, to determine fair value for these derivatives based on extrapolation of observable future prices and rates. Derivatives valued using Level 3 inputs primarily include long dated derivative power contracts and NGL and natural gas contracts, basis swaps, commodity swaps, power and energy swaps, as well as options. We do not have any other financial instruments categorized in Level 3 Level 3 We have also categorized the fair value of our held to maturity preferred share investment and long term debt as Level 2 The fair value of our held to maturity preferred share investment is primarily based on the yield of certain Government of Canada bonds. The fair value of our long term debt is based on quoted market prices for instruments of similar yield, credit risk and tenor. include inputs such as quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors and broker quotes that can be observed or corroborated in the market for the entire duration of the derivative. Derivatives valued using Level 2 inputs include non exchange traded derivatives such as over the counter foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contracts, interest rate swaps, physical forward commodity contracts, as well as commodity swaps and options for which observable inputs can be obtained. 170 Level 2 includes derivative valuations determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Derivatives in this category are valued using models or other industry standard valuation techniques derived from observable market data. Such valuation techniques Level 2 Level 1 includes derivatives measured at fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. An active market for a derivative is considered to be a market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our Level 1 instruments consist primarily of exchange traded derivatives used to mitigate the risk of crude oil price fluctuations. Level 1 We categorize our derivative instruments measured at fair value into 1 of 3 different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include derivative instruments. We also disclose the fair value of other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The fair value of financial instruments reflects our best estimates of market value based on generally accepted valuation techniques or models and is supported by observable market prices and rates. When such values are not available, we use discounted cash flow analysis from applicable yield curves based on observable market inputs to estimate fair value. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS as past due. The maximum exposure to credit risk related to non derivative financial assets is their carrying value. 30 days Credit risk also arises from trade and other long term receivables, and is mitigated through credit exposure limits and contractual requirements, assessment of credit ratings and netting arrangements. Within EGD and Union Gas, credit risk is mitigated by the utilities' large and diversified customer base and the ability to recover an estimate for doubtful accounts through the ratemaking process. We actively monitor the financial strength of large industrial customers and, in select cases, have obtained additional security to minimize the risk of default on receivables. Generally, we classify and provide for receivables older than Gross derivative balances have been presented without the effects of collateral posted. Derivative assets are adjusted for non performance risk of our counterparties using their credit default swap spread rates, and are reflected at fair value. For derivative liabilities, our non performance risk is considered in the valuation. . December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 , we provided letters of credit totaling nil in lieu of providing cash collateral to our counterparties pursuant to the terms of the relevant ISDA agreements.

In order to mitigate this risk, we enter into risk management transactions primarily with institutions that possess strong investment grade credit ratings. Credit risk relating to derivative counterparties is mitigated through maintenance and monitoring of credit exposure limits and contractual requirements, netting arrangements, and ongoing monitoring of counterparty credit exposure using external credit rating services and other analytical tools. CREDIT RISK . As a result, all credit facilities are available to us and the banks are obligated to fund and have been funding us under the terms of the facilities. December 31, 2018 without accessing the capital markets. We are in compliance with all the terms and conditions of our committed credit facility agreements and term debt indentures as at 1 year month rolling time period to determine whether sufficient funds will be available and maintain substantial capacity under our committed bank lines of credit to address any contingencies. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are funds generated from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and draws under committed credit facilities and long term debt, which includes debentures and medium term notes. We also maintain current shelf prospectuses with securities regulators which enables, subject to market conditions, ready access to either the Canadian or United States public capital markets. In addition, we maintain sufficient liquidity through committed credit facilities with a diversified group of banks and institutions which, if necessary, enables us to fund all anticipated requirements for approximately 12 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations, including commitments and guarantees, as they become due.

These agreements provide for the net settlement of derivative instruments outstanding with specific counterparties in the event of bankruptcy or other significant credit events, and reduces our credit risk exposure on financial derivative asset positions outstanding with the counterparties in those circumstances. The following table summarizes the maximum potential settlement amounts in the event of these specific circumstances. All amounts are presented gross in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table summarizes the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position location and carrying value of our derivative instruments. TOTAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS form of stock based compensation, restricted share units. We use a combination of qualifying and non qualifying derivative instruments to manage equity price risk. 1 Equity price risk is the risk of earnings fluctuations due to changes in our share price. We have exposure to our own common share price through the issuance of various forms of stock based compensation, which affect earnings through revaluation of the outstanding units every period. We use equity derivatives to manage the earnings volatility derived from Equity Price Risk Our earnings and cash flows are exposed to changes in commodity prices as a result of our ownership interests in certain assets and investments, as well as through the activities of our energy services subsidiaries. These commodities include natural gas, crude oil, power and NGL. We employ financial and physical derivative instruments to fix a portion of the variable price exposures that arise from physical transactions involving these commodities. We use primarily non qualifying derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk. Commodity Price Risk 163 We primarily use qualifying derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. of floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. 30% We also monitor our debt portfolio mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments to manage a consolidated portfolio of floating rate debt within the Board of Directors approved policy limit of a maximum of . 32% Our earnings and cash flows are also exposed to variability in longer term interest rates ahead of anticipated fixed rate term debt issuances. Forward starting interest rate swaps are used to hedge against the effect of future interest rate movements. We have established a program within some of our subsidiaries to mitigate our exposure to long term interest rate variability on select forecast term debt issuances via execution of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with an average swap rate of . . As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any pay floating receive fixed interest rate swaps outstanding We are exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt that arise as a result of the changes in market interest rates. Pay floating receive fixed interest rate swaps are used, when applicable, to hedge against future changes to the fair value of fixed rate debt which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in the fair value of fixed rate debt via execution of fixed to floating interest rate swaps . 28% Our earnings and cash flows are exposed to short term interest rate variability due to the regular repricing of our variable rate debt, primarily commercial paper. Pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps may be used to hedge against the effect of future interest rate movements. We have implemented a program to significantly mitigate the impact of short term interest rate volatility on interest expense via execution of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with an average swap rate of Interest Rate Risk A combination of qualifying and non qualifying derivative instruments are used to hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses, and to manage variability in cash flows. We hedge certain net investments in United States dollar denominated investments and subsidiaries using foreign currency derivatives and United States dollar denominated debt. We employ financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency denominated earnings exposure. We generate certain revenues, incur expenses, and hold a number of investments and subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variability. Foreign Exchange Risk The following summarizes the types of market risks to which we are exposed and the risk management instruments used to mitigate them. We use a combination of qualifying and non qualifying derivative instruments to manage the risks noted below. Our earnings, cash flows and OCI are subject to movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and our share price (collectively, market risks). Formal risk management policies, processes and systems have been designed to mitigate these risks.

The majority of the costs, primarily consulting fees, are being capitalized to gas mains in accordance with regulatory approval. As at With the approval of regulators, certain operations capitalize a percentage of specified operating costs. These operations are authorized to charge depreciation and earn a return on the net book value of such capitalized costs in future years. In the absence of rate regulation, a portion of such operating costs would be charged to earnings in the year incurred. Operating Cost Capitalization Under the pool method prescribed by certain regulators, it is not possible to identify the carrying value of the equity comp1nt of AFUDC or its effect on depreciation. Similarly, gains and losses on the retirement of certain specific fixed assets in any given year cannot be identified or quantified. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Other Capitalized Costs OTHER Item AFFECTED BY RATE REGULATION Future removal and site restoration reserves result from amounts collected from customers by the Company, with the approval of the OEB, to fund future costs for removal and site restoration relating to property, plant and equipment. These costs are collected as part of depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment that is recorded in rates. The balance represents the amount that the Company has collected from customers, net of actual costs expended on removal and site restoration. The settlement of this balance will occur over the long term as future removal and site restoration costs are incurred. In the absence of rate regulation accounting, costs incurred for removal and site restoration would be charged to earnings as incurred with recognition of revenue for amounts previously collected. 5 The balances are excluded from the rate base and do not earn an ROE. 4 Purchase gas variance is the difference between the actual cost and the approved cost of natural gas reflected in rates. EGD and Union Gas have been granted OEB approval to refund this balance to, or to collect this balance from, customers on a rolling 12 month basis via the Quarterly Rate Adjustment Mechanism process. 3 Relates to the establishment of a regulatory liability as a result of the United States tax reform legislation enacted December 22, 2017. 2 .

Within annual rate proceedings for 2015 through 2018, the customized IR plan requires allowed revenues, and corresponding rates, to be updated annually for select Item. 123 As part of the customized IR Plan, the OEB approved the adoption of a new approach for determining net salvage percentages to be included within EGD approved depreciation rates, as compared with the traditional approach previously employed. The new approach results in lower net salvage percentages for EGD, and therefore lowers depreciation rates and future removal and site restoration reserves. The customized IR Plan also includes an earnings sharing mechanism, whereby any return over the allowed EGD gas distribution operations are regulated by the OEB. Rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were set in accordance with parameters established by the customized incentive rate plan (IR Plan). The customized IR Plan, inclusive of the requested capital investment amounts and an incentive mechanism providing the opportunity to earn above the allowed ROE, was approved, with modifications, by the OEB in 2014.

Prices for commodities sold are determined by reference to market price indices plus or minus a negotiated differential and in certain cases a marketing fee. Prices for gas processing and transportation services are determined based on the capital cost of the facilities, pipelines and associated infrastructure required to provide such services plus a rate of return on capital invested that is determined either through negotiations with customers or through regulatory processes for those operations that are subject to rate regulation. Determination of Transaction Prices For arrangements involving the transportation and sale of petroleum products and natural gas where the transportation services or commodities are simultaneously received and consumed by the shipper or customer, we recognize revenue over time using an output method based on volumes of commodities delivered or transported. The measurement of the volumes transported or delivered corresponds directly to the benefits received by the shippers or customers during that period. Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time Revenue from commodity sales where the commodity sold is not immediately consumed prior to use is recognized at the point in time when the contractually specified volume of the commodity has been delivered, as control over the commodity transfers to the customer upon delivery. Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time Revenue from crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation, storage, natural gas gathering, compression and treating, natural gas distribution, natural gas storage services and electricity sales. 2 Revenue from sales of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. 1 21,150 559 5,447 6,555 8,589 Total revenue from contracts with customers 19,492 559 5,379 4,965 8,589 2 Revenue from products and services transferred over time 1,658 68 1,590 1 Revenue from products transferred at a point in time (millions of Canadian dollars) Year ended December 31, 2018 Consolidated Energy Services Green Power and Transmission Gas Distribution Gas Transmission and Midstream Liquids Pipelines Recognition and Measurement of Revenue Revenue from arrangements subject to variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Uncertainties associated with variable consideration relate principally to differences between estimated and actual volumes and prices. These uncertainties are resolved each month when actual volumes are sold or transported and actual tolls and prices are determined. Estimates of Variable Consideration period. Transportation revenue from interruptible or volumetric based arrangements is recognized when services are performed. 118 For long term transportation agreements, significant judgments pertain to the period over which revenue is recognized and whether the agreement provides for make up rights for the shippers. Transportation revenue earned from firm contracted capacity arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract Long Term Transportation Agreements SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS MADE IN RECOGNIZING REVENUE The revenues excluded from the amounts above based on optional exemptions available under ASC 606, as explained below, represent a significant portion of our overall revenues and revenues from contracts with customers. Certain revenues such as flow through operating costs charged to shippers are recognized at the amount for which we have the right to invoice our customers and are excluded from the amounts for revenue to be recognized in the future from unfulfilled performance obligations above. Variable consideration is excluded from the amounts above due to the uncertainty of the associated consideration, which is generally resolved when actual volumes and prices are determined. For example, we consider interruptible transportation service revenues to be variable revenues since volumes cannot be estimated. Additionally, the effect of escalation on certain tolls which are contractually escalated for inflation has not been reflected in the amounts above as it is not possible to reliably estimate future inflation rates. Revenues for periods extending beyond the current rate settlement term for regulated contracts where the tolls are periodically reset by the regulator are excluded from the amounts above since future tolls remain unknown. Finally, revenues from contracts with customers which have an original expected duration of 1 year or less are excluded from the amounts above. is expected to be recognized during the year ending December 31, 2019. 7.1 billion , of which $ 67.4 billion Total revenue from performance obligations expected to be fulfilled in future periods is $ Revenue to be Recognized from Unfulfilled Performance Obligations Certain contracts in the United States offshore business provide for us to receive a series of fixed monthly payments (FMPs) for a specified period which is less than the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied. As a result, a portion of the FMPs is recorded as a contract liability. The FMPs are not considered to be a financing arrangement because the payments are scheduled to match the production profiles of offshore oil and gas fields, which generate greater revenue in the initial years of their productive lives. Payments are received monthly from customers under long term transportation, commodity sales, and gas gathering and processing contracts. Payments from Gas Distribution customers are received on a continuous basis based on established billing cycles.

Note 8 Acquisitions and Dispositions Contract receivables represent the amount of receivables derived from contracts with customers.

This estimate represents the net present value of future lease payments payable under operating lease contracts we had entered into as at November 30, 2018, and that have commenced or are scheduled to commence by January 1, 2019. We do not expect any adjustments will be made to our accounting for existing lessor contracts as a result of implementing this new standard. $900 million to $750 million We have identified all lease contracts existing as at November 30, 2018 and have performed detailed evaluations of those lease contracts under the requirements of the transitional guidance. We estimate that we will recognize right of use lease assets and related lease liabilities for existing operating leases where we are the lessee in the range of In July 2018, ASU 2018 11 was issued to address additional stakeholder concerns regarding the unanticipated costs and complexities associated with the modified retrospective transition method as well as the requirement for lessors to separate comp1nts of a contract. Under the new guidance, entities are provided with an additional transition method which allows entities to apply the new standard at the date of adoption and to elect not to recast comparative periods presented. This amendment also permits lessors to combine associated lease and non lease comp1nts within a contract for operating leases when certain conditions are met. We have elected both of these practical expedients in the adoption of the new lease standard. ASU 2018 01 was issued in January 2018 to address stakeholder concerns about the costs and complexity of complying with the transition provisions of the new lease requirements as they relate to land easements. The amendments provide an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under existing guidance. We have elected this practical expedient in connection with the adoption of the new lease requirements. ASU 2016 02 was issued in February 2016 with the intent to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. It requires lessees of operating lease arrangements to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the statements of financial position and disclose additional key information about lease agreements. The accounting update also replaces the current definition of a lease and requires that an arrangement be recognized as a lease when a customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an asset, as well as the right to direct the use of the asset. The new standard became effective January 1, 2019 and in adopting ASC 842, we have applied the package of practical expedients offered in connection with this update. Application of the package of practical expedients permits entities not to reassess a) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases in accordance with the new guidance, b) lease classifications, and c) whether initial direct costs capitalized under current guidance continue to meet the definition of initial direct costs under the new guidance. Under the new lease guidance, we have also decided to elect, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non lease comp1nts from the associated lease comp1nts of our lessee contract and account for both comp1nts as a single lease comp1nt. Recognition of Leases accounted for under the new leases standard, ASC 842, and are not within the scope of ASC 326, Financial Instrument Credit Losses. Both accounting updates are effective January 1, 2020. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 115 Further, ASU 2018 19 was issued in November 2018 to clarify that operating lease receivables should be ASU 2016 13 was issued in June 2016 with the intent of providing financial statement users with more useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. Current treatment uses the incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays the recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The accounting update adds a new impairment model, known as the current expected credit loss model, which is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity will recognize as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the Financial Accounting Standards Board believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. Accounting for Credit Losses ASU 2017 08 was issued in March 2017 with the intent of shortening the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. The accounting update is effective January 1, 2019 and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Amending the Amortization Period for Certain Callable Debt Securities Purchased at a Premium In October 2018, ASU 2018 16 was issued to permit the use of the Overnight Index Swap rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. ASU 2018 16 is effective concurrently with ASU 2017 12 ASU 2017 12 was issued in August 2017 with the objective of better aligning a company risk management activities and the resulting hedge accounting reflected in the financial statements. The amendments allow cash flow hedging of contractually specified comp1nts in financial and non financial Item. Under the new guidance, hedge ineffectiveness is no longer required to be measured and hedging instruments fair value changes will be recorded in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The ASU also allows the initial quantitative hedge effectiveness assessment to be performed at any time before the end of the quarter in which the hedge is designated. After initial quantitative testing is performed, an ongoing qualitative effectiveness assessment is permitted. The accounting update is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis. Based upon our current assessment, we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities ASU 2018 13 was issued to improve the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by eliminating and modifying some disclosures, while also adding new disclosures. This update is effective January 1, 2020, however entities are permitted to early adopt the eliminated or modified disclosures. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018 14 was issued in August 2018 to improve disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendment modifies the current guidance by adding and removing several disclosure requirements while also clarifying the guidance on current disclosure requirements. ASU 2018 14 is effective January 1, 2021 and entities are permitted to adopt the standard early. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 2 amendments as a part of its disclosure framework project aimed to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements. Disclosure Effectiveness the standard as of January 1, 2019, as permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 114 In August 2018, ASU 2018 15 was issued to provide guidance on the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA) that is a service contract. The amendment aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a CCA that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use software. Additionally, ASU 2018 15 specifies that an entity would apply ASC 350 40, Internal use software, to determine which implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Furthermore, the amendments in the update require capitalized costs be amortized on a straight line basis generally over the term of the arrangement and presented in the same income statement line as fees paid for the hosting service. The new standard also requires that the balance sheet presentation of capitalized implementation costs to be the same as that of the prepayment of fees related to the hosting arrangement, as well as similar consistency in classifications from a cash flow statement perspective. ASU 2018 15 is effective January 1, 2020 and we have elected to early adopt Amended Guidance on Cloud Computing Arrangements ASU 2018 17 was issued in October 2018 to improve the related party guidance on determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers ( decision maker fees ) are variable interests. Under the new guidance, reporting entities must consider indirect interests held through related parties in common control arrangements on a proportionate basis, rather than as the equivalent of a direct interest in its entirety, when determining if a decision maker fees constitute a variable interest. The accounting update is effective January 1, 2020 and must be applied on a retrospective basis. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities In November 2018, ASU 2018 18 was issued to provide clarity on when transactions between entities in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under the new revenue standard, ASC 606. In determining whether transactions in collaborative arrangements should be accounted under the revenue standard, the update specifies that entities shall apply unit of account guidance to identify distinct goods or services and whether such goods and services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. ASU 2018 18 also precludes entities from presenting transactions with a collaborative partner which are not in scope of the new revenue standard together with revenue from contracts with customers. The accounting update is effective January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.

For the 113 The below table presents the cumulative, immaterial effect of the adoption of ASC 606 on our Certain payments received from customers to offset the cost of constructing assets required to provide services to those customers, referred to as Contributions in Aid of Construction (CIACs) were previously recorded as reductions of property, plant and equipment regardless of whether the amounts were imposed by regulation or arose from negotiations with customers. Under the new revenue standard, CIACs which are negotiated as part of an agreement to provide transportation and other services to a customer are deemed to be advance payments for future services and are recognized as revenue when those future services are provided. Accordingly, negotiated CIACs are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the term of the associated revenue contract. Amounts which are required to be collected from the customer based on requirements of the regulator continue to be accounted for as reductions of property, plant and equipment. Revenue was previously recognized for a certain contract within the Liquids Pipelines business unit using a formula based method. Under the new revenue standard, revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement in order to reflect the fulfillment of our performance obligation to provide up to a specified volume of pipeline capacity throughout the term of the contract. In adopting Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, we applied the practical expedient for contract modifications whereby contracts that were modified before January 1, 2018 were not retrospectively restated. Instead, the aggregate effect of all contract modifications occurring before that time has been reflected when identifying satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014 09 on a modified retrospective basis to contracts that were not complete at the date of initial application. The new standard was issued with the intent of significantly enhancing consistency and comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and industries. The new standard establishes a single, principles based five step model to be applied to all contracts with customers and introduces new and enhanced disclosure requirements. It also requires the use of more estimates and judgments than the previous standards. Revenue from Contracts with Customers Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016 01 on a prospective basis. The new standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. Investments in equity securities, excluding equity method and consolidated investments, are no longer classified as trading or available for sale securities. All investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are classified as investments at fair value through net income. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured using the fair value measurement alternative and are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in equity securities measured using the fair value measurement alternative are reviewed for indicators of impairment each reporting period. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities is measured using the exit price notion. The adoption of this accounting update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016 15 on a retrospective basis. The new standard reduces diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new guidance addresses eight specific presentation issues. We assessed each of the eight specific presentation issues and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Simplifying Cash Flow Classification periods, we amended the presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents. 112 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016 18 on a retrospective basis. The new standard clarifies guidance on the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents within the statement of cash flows. The amendments require that changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included within cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the opening and closing period amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. For current and comparative Clarifying the Presentation of Restricted Cash in the Statement of Cash Flows Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017 05 on a modified retrospective basis. The new standard clarifies the scope provisions of nonfinancial assets and how to allocate consideration to each distinct asset, and amends the guidance for derecognition of a distinct nonfinancial asset in partial sale transactions. The adoption of this accounting update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Clarifying Guidance on Derecognition and Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017 07 which was issued primarily to improve the income statement presentation of the comp1nts of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost for an entity sponsored defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Upon adoption of this accounting update, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings presents the current service cost within Operating and administrative expenses and the other comp1nts of net benefit cost within Other income (expense). Previously, all comp1nts of net benefit cost were presented within Operating and administrative expenses. In addition, only the service cost comp1nt of net benefit cost will be capitalized on a prospective basis. The adoption of this accounting update did not, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Benefit Cost related to Defined Benefit Plans Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017 09 and applied the standard on a prospective basis. The new standard was issued to clarify the scope of modification accounting. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required for all changes to share based payment awards, unless all of the following conditions are met 1) there is no change to the fair value of the award, 2) the vesting conditions have not changed, and 3) the classification of the award as an equity instrument or a debt instrument has not changed. The adoption of this accounting update did not, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Clarifying Guidance on the Application of Modification Accounting on Stock Compensation Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018 02 to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA or United States Tax Reform) enacted by the United States federal government on December 22, 2017. The amendments in this accounting update allowed a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA. The amendments eliminated the stranded tax effects recognized as a result of the reduction of the historical United States federal corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted United States federal corporate income tax rate. The adoption of this accounting update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There were no changes in accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2018. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3 the minimum of the range of probable loss is accrued. We expense legal costs associated with loss contingencies as such costs are incurred. 111 Liabilities for other commitments and contingencies are recognized when, after fully analyzing available information, we determine it is either probable that an asset has been impaired, or that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we recognize the most likely amount, or if no amount is more likely than another, We expense or capitalize, as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to past or current operations. We expense costs incurred for remediation of existing environmental contamination caused by past operations that do not benefit future periods by preventing or eliminating future contamination. We record liabilities for environmental matters when assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites, other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information and are included in Environmental liabilities and Other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at their undiscounted amounts. There is always a potential of incurring additional costs in connection with environmental liabilities due to variations in any or all of the categories described above, including modified or revised requirements from regulatory agencies, in addition to fines and penalties, as well as expenditures associated with litigation and settlement of claims. We evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from the liability and, when recovery is probable, we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES month term. During the vesting term, compensation expense is recorded based on the number of units outstanding and the current market price of Enbridge shares with an offset to Accounts payable and other or to Other long term liabilities. 35 Restricted Stock Units (RSU) are cash settled awards for which the related liability is remeasured each reporting period. RSUs vest at the completion of a Incentive Stock Options (ISO) granted are recorded using the fair value method. Under this method, compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the ISO granted as calculated by the Black Scholes Merton model and is recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period to early retirement eligibility, with a corresponding credit to Additional paid in capital. Balances in Additional paid in capital are transferred to Share capital when the options are exercised. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION Certain regulated utility operations of Enbridge record regulatory adjustments to reflect the difference between pension expense and OPEB costs for accounting purposes and the pension expense and OPEB costs for ratemaking purposes. Offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to the extent pension expense or OPEB costs are expected to be collected from or refunded to customers, respectively, in future rates. In the absence of rate regulation, regulatory balances would not be recorded and pension and OPEB costs would be charged to earnings and OCI on an accrual basis. The overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans is recognized as Deferred amounts and other assets, Accounts payable and other or Other long term liabilities, on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. A plan funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the plan projected benefit obligation. Any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that arise during the period are recognized as a comp1nt of OCI, net of tax. We also provide OPEB other than pensions, including group health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees, their spouses and qualified dependents. The cost of such benefits is accrued during the years in which employees render service. 110 For defined contribution plans, contributions made by Enbridge are expensed in the period in which the contribution occurs. Pension plan assets are measured at fair value. The expected return on pension plan assets is determined using market related values and assumptions on the specific invested asset mix within the pension plans. The market related values reflect estimated return on investments consistent with long term historical averages for similar assets. Actuarial gains and losses arise from the difference between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets for that period or from changes in actuarial assumptions used to determine the accrued benefit obligation, including discount rate, changes in headcount or salary inflation experience. Amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the accrued benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets, over the expected average remaining service life of the active employee group covered by the plans. Amortization of the prior service costs and amendments on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans; and Expected return on pension plan assets; Interest cost of pension plan obligations; Cost of pension plan benefits provided in exchange for employee services rendered during the year; We use mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries in the United States (revised in 2018) and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries tables (revised in 2014) to measure our benefit obligations of our United States pension plan (the United States Plan) and our Canadian pension plans (the Canadian Plans), respectively. We determine discount rates by reference to rates of high quality long term corporate bonds with maturities that approximate the timing of future payments we anticipate making under each of the respective plans. Pension cost is charged to earnings and includes Defined benefit pension plan costs are determined using actuarial methods and are funded through contributions determined using the projected benefit method, which incorporates management best estimates of future salary levels, other cost escalations, retirement ages of employees and other actuarial factors including discount rates and mortality. We maintain pension plans which provide defined benefit and defined contribution pension benefits. RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARO associated with the retirement of long lived assets are measured at fair value and recognized as Accounts payable and other or Other long term liabilities in the period in which they can be reasonably determined. The fair value approximates the cost a third party would charge to perform the tasks necessary to retire such assets and is recognized at the present value of expected future cash flows. ARO are added to the carrying value of the associated asset and depreciated over the asset useful life. The corresponding liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings and is reduced by actual costs of decommissioning and reclamation. Our estimates of retirement costs could change as a result of changes in cost estimates and regulatory requirements. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS With respect to other financial assets, we assess the assets for impairment when there is no longer reasonable assurance of timely collection. If evidence of impairment is noted, we reduce the value of the financial asset to its estimated realizable amount, determined using discounted expected future cash flows. value is other than temporary. If the decline is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in earnings with an offsetting reduction to the carrying value of the asset. 109 With respect to investments in debt securities, we assess at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired by completing a quantitative or qualitative analysis of factors impacting the investment. If there is objective evidence of impairment, we value the expected discounted cash flows using observable market inputs and determine whether the decline below carrying We review the carrying values of our long lived assets as events or changes in circumstances warrant. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, we calculate fair value based on the discounted cash flows and write the assets down to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. IMPAIRMENT The allocation of goodwill to held for sale and disposed businesses is based on the relative fair value of businesses included in the particular reporting unit. Fair value of our reporting unit is estimated using a combination of discounted cash flow model and earnings multiples techniques. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow model technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, projected operating income, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and working capital levels. The cash flow projections included significant judgments and assumptions relating to revenue growth rates and expected future capital expenditure. The determination of fair value using the earnings multiples technique requires assumptions to be made in relation to maintainable earnings and earnings multipliers for reporting units. reporting units. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair value of our reporting units and comparing those values to the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value. This amount should not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 2 We perform our annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the comp1nts of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those comp1nts and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our reportable segments, with the exception of the gas transmission and gas midstream reportable segment which is divided at the comp1nt level into Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets on acquisition of a business. The carrying value of goodwill, which is not amortized, is assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. We perform our annual review of the goodwill balance on April 1 GOODWILL Customer relationships represent the underlying relationship from long term agreements with customers that are capitalized upon acquisition. From January 1, 2017 through July 3, 2018, emission allowances, which are recorded at their original cost, were purchased in order to meet greenhouse gas (GHG) compliance obligations. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over their expected lives, commencing when the asset is available for use, with the exception of emission allowances, which are not amortized as they will be used to satisfy compliance obligations as they come due. . Intangible assets consist primarily of certain software costs, customer relationships and emission allowances. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software projects INTANGIBLE ASSETS contractual receivables under the terms of long term delivery contracts; and derivative financial instruments. 108 Deferred amounts and other assets primarily include costs which regulatory authorities have permitted, or are expected to permit, to be recovered through future rates including deferred income taxes; DEFERRED AMOUNTS AND OTHER ASSETS primary methods of depreciation are utilized. For distinct assets, depreciation is generally provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets commencing when the asset is placed in service. For largely homogeneous groups of assets with comparable useful lives, the pool method of accounting for property, plant and equipment is followed whereby similar assets are grouped and depreciated as a pool. When group assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains and losses are generally not reflected in earnings but are booked as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation. 2 Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Expenditures for construction, expansion, major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for project development are capitalized if they are expected to have future benefit. We capitalize interest incurred during construction for non rate regulated assets. For rate regulated assets, AFUDC is included in the cost of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over future periods as part of the total cost of the related asset. AFUDC includes both an interest comp1nt and, if approved by the regulator, a cost of equity comp1nt. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Inventory is comprised of natural gas in storage held in EGD and Union Gas, and crude oil and natural gas held primarily by energy services businesses in the Energy Services segment. Natural gas in storage in EGD and Union Gas is recorded at the quarterly prices approved by the OEB in the determination of distribution rates. The actual price of gas purchased may differ from the OEB approved price. The difference between the approved price and the actual cost of the gas purchased is deferred as a liability for future refund or as an asset for collection as approved by the OEB. Other commodities inventory is recorded at the lower of cost, as determined on a weighted average basis, or market value. Upon disposition, other commodities inventory is recorded to Commodity costs on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings at the weighted average cost of inventory, including any adjustments recorded to reduce inventory to market value. INVENTORY The Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include in kind balances as a result of differences in gas volumes received and delivered for customers. Since settlement of certain imbalances is in kind, changes in the balances do not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Most natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at natural gas market index prices as at the balance sheet dates. NATURAL GAS IMBALANCES Allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on collection history. When we have determined that further collection efforts are unlikely to be successful, amounts charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts are applied against the impaired accounts receivable. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Affiliate long term notes receivable are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any impairment losses recognized. Accounts receivable and other are measured at cost. LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage, in accordance with specific commercial arrangements, are presented as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. RESTRICTED CASH 107 Cash and cash equivalents include short term investments with a term to maturity of 3 months or less when purchased. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Gains and losses arising from translation of foreign operations functional currencies to our Canadian dollar presentation currency are included in the CTA comp1nt of AOCI and are recognized in earnings upon sale of the foreign operation. Asset and liability accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Foreign currency transactions are those transactions whose terms are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which Enbridge or a reporting subsidiary operates, referred to as the functional currency. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. M1tary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses resulting from translation of m1tary assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period in which they arise. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for accounting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate that is expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse. For our regulated operations, a deferred income tax liability or asset is recognized with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability, respectively, to the extent taxes can be recovered through rates. Any interest and or penalty incurred related to tax is reflected in income taxes. INCOME TAXES The use of the HLBV method by ECT impacts the earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reported on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for comparative periods. Enbridge Income Fund (The Fund)'s noncontrolling interest holders had the option to redeem the Fund trust units for cash, subject to certain limitations. Redeemable noncontrolling interests as at December 31, 2017 are recognized at the maximum redemption value of the trust units held by third parties, which references the market price of ENF common shares. On a quarterly basis and up until redeemable noncontrolling interest repurchase date, changes in estimated redemption values are reflected as a charge or credit to retained earnings. Noncontrolling interests represent ownership interests attributable to third parties in certain consolidated subsidiaries. The portion of equity not owned by us in such entities is reflected as Noncontrolling interests within the equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and, in the case of redeemable noncontrolling interests as at December 31, 2017, within the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position between long term liabilities and equity. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS Investments in debt securities are classified either as available for sale securities measured at fair value through OCI or as held to maturity securities measured at amortized cost. from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in equity securities measured using the fair value measurement alternative are reviewed for impairment each reporting period. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value through net income. Dividends received from investments in equity securities are recognized in earnings when the right to receive payment is established. 106 Generally, we classify equity investments in entities over which we do not exercise significant influence and that do not have readily determinable fair values as other investments measured at fair value measurement alternative and recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting OTHER INVESTMENTS Long term investments that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage, for the purposes of the NEB LMCI, are presented as Restricted long term investments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. RESTRICTED LONG TERM INVESTMENTS Equity investments over which we exercise significant influence, but do not have controlling financial interests, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity investments are initially measured at cost and are adjusted for our proportionate share of undistributed equity earnings or loss. Equity investments are increased for contributions made to and decreased for distributions received from the investees. To the extent an equity investee undertakes activities necessary to commence its planned principal operations, we capitalize interest costs associated with its investment during such period. EQUITY INVESTMENTS Transaction costs are incremental costs directly related to the acquisition of a financial asset or the issuance of a financial liability. We incur transaction costs primarily from the issuance of debt and account for these costs as a deduction from Long term debt on the Statements of Financial Position. These costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt instrument and are recorded in Interest expense. Transaction Costs Assets and liabilities arising from derivative instruments may be offset in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when we have the legal right and intention to settle them on a net basis. Balance Sheet Offset Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are classified as Operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We recognize the fair market value of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as current and non current assets or liabilities depending on the timing of the settlements and the resulting cash flows associated with the instruments. Fair value amounts related to cash flows occurring beyond 1 year are classified as non current. Classification of Derivatives Gains and losses arising from translation of net investment in foreign operations from their functional currencies to Enbridge Canadian dollar presentation currency are included in cumulative translation adjustments (CTA). We designate foreign currency derivatives and United States dollar denominated debt as hedges of net investments in United States dollar denominated foreign operations. As a result, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives as well as the translation of United States dollar denominated debt are reflected in OCI and any ineffectiveness is reflected in current period earnings. Amounts recognized previously in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) are reclassified to earnings when there is a reduction of the hedged net investment resulting from disposal of a foreign operation. Net Investment Hedges We use fair value hedges to hedge the fair value of debt instruments. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is designated as part of the hedging relationship. If a fair value hedge is discontinued or ceases to be effective, the hedged asset or liability, otherwise required to be carried at cost or amortized cost, ceases to be remeasured at fair value and the cumulative fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged Item 1s recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item. 105 Fair Value Hedges If a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge ceases to be effective or is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued and the gain or loss at that date is deferred in OCI and recognized concurrently with the related transaction. If a hedged anticipated transaction is no longer probable, the gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings. Subsequent gains and losses from derivative instruments for which hedge accounting has been discontinued are recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. We use cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain compensation tied to our share price. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a cash flow hedging instrument is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) and is reclassified to earnings when the hedged Item 1mpacts earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in current period earnings. Cash Flow Hedges We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain compensation tied to our share price. Hedge accounting is optional and requires Enbridge to document the hedging relationship and test the hedging item effectiveness in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged item on an ongoing basis. We present the earnings effects of hedging Item with the hedged transaction. Derivatives in qualifying hedging relationships are categorized as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. Derivatives in Qualifying Hedging Relationships Non qualifying derivative instruments are used primarily to economically hedge foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price earnings exposure. Non qualifying derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in Transportation and other services revenues, Commodity costs, Operating and administrative expense, Other income (expense) and Interest expense. Non qualifying Derivatives DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING Our Energy Services segment enters into commodity purchase and sale arrangements that are recorded gross because the related contracts are not held for trading purposes and we are acting as the principal in the transactions. For our energy marketing contracts, an estimate of revenues and commodity costs for the month of December is included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each year based on the best available volume and price data for the commodity delivered and received. For rate regulated businesses, revenues are recognized in a manner that is consistent with the underlying agreements as approved by the regulators. Natural gas utilities revenues are recorded on the basis of regular meter readings and estimates of customer usage from the last meter reading to the end of the reporting period. Estimates are based on historical consumption patterns and heating degree days experienced. Heating degree days is a measure of coldness that is indicative of volumetric requirements for natural gas utilized for heating purposes in our distribution franchise area. Since July 1, 2011, Canadian Mainline (excluding Lines 8 and 9) earnings are governed by the Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS), under which revenues are recorded when services are performed. Effective on that date, we prospectively discontinued the application of rate regulated accounting for those assets with the exception of flow through income taxes covered by specific rate orders. , respectively. $249 million , and $196 million , $208 million , cash received net of revenue recognized for contracts under make up rights and similar deferred revenue arrangements was 2016 and 2017 , December 31, 2018 shippers throughout the contract period, regardless of when cash is received. For the years ended 104 Certain offshore pipeline transportation contracts require Enbridge to provide transportation services for the life of the underlying producing fields. Under these arrangements, shippers pay Enbridge a fixed monthly toll for a defined period of time which may be shorter than the estimated reserve life of the underlying producing fields, resulting in a contract period which extends past the period of cash collection. Fixed monthly toll revenues are recognized ratably over the committed volume made available to Long term take or pay contracts, under which shippers are obligated to pay fixed amounts rateably over the contract period regardless of volumes shipped, may contain make up rights. Make up rights are earned by shippers when minimum volume commitments are not utilized during the period but under certain circumstances can be used to offset overages in future periods, subject to expiry periods. We recognize revenues associated with make up rights at the earlier of when the make up volume is shipped, the make up right expires or when it is determined that the likelihood that the shipper will utilize the make up right is remote. For businesses that are not rate regulated, revenues are recorded when products have been delivered or services have been performed, the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured. Customer credit worthiness is assessed prior to agreement signing, as well as throughout the contract duration. Certain revenues from liquids and gas pipeline businesses are recognized under the terms of committed delivery contracts rather than the cash tolls received. REVENUE RECOGNITION With the approval of the applicable regulator, EGD, Union Gas and certain distribution operations capitalize a percentage of specified operating costs. These operations are authorized to charge depreciation and earn a return on the net book value of such capitalized costs in future years. To the extent that the regulator actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of capitalized costs could differ significantly from those recorded. In the absence of rate regulation, a portion of such costs may be charged to current period earnings. . (Note 7) deferred regulatory asset is recorded no For certain regulated operations to which U.S. GAAP guidance for phase in plans applies, negotiated depreciation rates recovered in transportation tolls may be less than the depreciation expense calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in early years of long term contracts but recovered in future periods when tolls exceed depreciation. Depreciation expense on such assets is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP and Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is included in the cost of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over future periods as part of the total cost of the related asset. AFUDC includes both an interest comp1nt and, if approved by the regulator, a cost of equity comp1nt, which are both capitalized based on rates set out in a regulatory agreement. In the absence of rate regulation, we would capitalize interest using a capitalization rate based on its cost of borrowing, whereas the capitalized equity comp1nt, the corresponding earnings during the construction phase and the subsequent depreciation would not be recognized. NEB Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI). Long term regulatory assets are recorded in Deferred amounts and other assets and current regulatory assets are recorded in Accounts receivable and other. Long term regulatory liabilities are included in Other long term liabilities and current regulatory liabilities are recorded in Accounts payable and other. Regulatory assets are assessed for impairment if we identify an event indicative of possible impairment. The recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on the actions, or expected future actions, of the regulator. To the extent that the regulator actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of regulatory balances could differ significantly from those recorded. In the absence of rate regulation, we would generally not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities and the earnings impact would be recorded in the period the expenses are incurred or revenues are earned. A regulatory asset or liability is recognized in respect of deferred income taxes when it is expected the amounts will be recovered or settled through future regulator approved rates. 103 Regulatory assets represent amounts that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates or expected to be paid to cover future abandonment costs in relation to the GAAP for non rate regulated entities. U.S. Regulatory bodies exercise statutory authority over matters such as construction, rates and ratemaking and agreements with customers. To recognize the economic effects of the actions of the regulator, the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses in these operations may differ from that otherwise expected under Certain parts of our businesses are subject to regulation by various authorities including, but not limited to, the National Energy Board (NEB), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Alberta Energy Regulator, the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board (NBEUB), the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) and La R gie de l Energie du Qu bec. REGULATION While ECT and EIPLP are both consolidated in these financial statements, the use of the HLBV method by ECT impacts the earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests reported on Enbridge Consolidated Statements of Earnings for comparative periods. Redeemable noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at December 31, 2017 are recognized at the maximum redemption value of the trust units held by third parties, which references the market price of ENF common shares. As a result of the Canadian Restructuring Plan, ECT, our subsidiary, determines its equity investment earnings from EIPLP using the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) method. ECT applies the HLBV method to its equity method investments where cash distributions, including both preference and residual distributions, are not based on the investor ownership percentages. Under the HLBV method, a calculation is prepared at each balance sheet date to determine the amount that ECT would receive if EIPLP were to liquidate all of its assets, as valued in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and distribute that cash to the investors. The difference between the calculated liquidation distribution amounts at the beginning and the end of the reporting period, after adjusting for capital contributions and distributions, is ECT share of the earnings or losses from the equity investment for the period. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Ownership interests in subsidiaries represented by other parties that do not control the entity are presented in the consolidated financial statements as activities and balances attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Investments and entities over which we exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Upon inception of a contractual agreement, we perform an assessment to determine whether the arrangement contains a variable interest in a legal entity and whether that legal entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Where we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consolidate the accounts of that VIE. We assess all variable interests in the entity and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary. Other qualitative factors that are considered include decision making responsibilities, the VIE capital structure, risk and rewards sharing, contractual agreements with the VIE, voting rights and level of involvement of other parties. We assess the primary beneficiary determination for a VIE on an ongoing basis, if there are changes in the facts and circumstances related to a VIE. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of any limited partnerships where we represent the general partner and, based on all facts and circumstances, control such limited partnerships, unless the limited partner has substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights. For certain investments where we retain an undivided interest in assets and liabilities, we record our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. If an entity is determined to not be a VIE, the voting interest entity model is applied, where an investor holding the majority voting rights consolidates the entity. 102 The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and accounts of our subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) for which we are the primary beneficiary. A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION to reflect this change. $0.3 billion Certain comparative figures in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. Effective September 30, 2017, we combined Cash and cash equivalents and amounts previously presented as Bank indebtedness where the corresponding bank accounts are subject to cash pooling arrangements.

have served as the Company auditor since 1949. February 15, 2019 Calgary, Alberta, Canada Chartered Professional Accountants s PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 93 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company consolidated financial statements and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. Basis for Opinions (2013) issued by the COSO. Internal Control Integrated Framework In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and their results of operations and their cash flows for each of the 3 years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Internal Control Integrated Framework We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Enbridge Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the 3 years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Enbridge Inc. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 92 The most observable inputs available are used to estimate the fair value of derivatives. When possible, we estimate the fair value of our derivatives based on quoted market prices from exchanges. If quoted market prices are not available, we use estimates from third party brokers. For non exchange traded derivatives classified in Levels 2 and 3, we use standard valuation techniques to calculate the estimated fair value. These methods include discounted cash flows for forwards and swaps and Black Scholes Merton pricing models for options. Depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying risk, we use observable market prices (interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices, as applicable) and volatility as primary inputs to these valuation techniques. Finally, we consider our own credit default swap spread, as well as the credit default swap spreads associated with our counterparties, in our estimation of fair value. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We generally have a policy of entering into individual International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. agreements or other similar derivative agreements with the majority of our financial derivative counterparties. These agreements provide for the net settlement of derivative instruments outstanding with specific counterparties in the event of bankruptcy or other significant credit events, and reduces our credit risk exposure on financial derivative asset positions outstanding with the counterparties in these particular circumstances. Entering into derivative instruments may result in exposure to credit risk from the possibility that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, we enter into risk management transactions primarily with institutions that possess strong investment grade credit ratings. Credit risk relating to derivative counterparties is mitigated through maintenance and monitoring of credit exposure limits and contractual requirements, netting arrangements, and ongoing monitoring of counterparty credit exposure using external credit rating services and other analytical tools. CREDIT RISK . As a result, all credit facilities are available to us and the banks are obligated to fund and have been funding us under the terms of the facilities. December 31, 2018 without accessing the capital markets. We are in compliance with all the terms and conditions of our committed credit facility agreements and term debt indentures as at 1 year month rolling time period to determine whether sufficient funds will be available and maintain substantial capacity under our committed bank lines of credit to address any contingencies. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are funds generated from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and draws under committed credit facilities and long term debt, which includes debentures and medium term notes. We also maintain current shelf prospectuses with securities regulators which enables, subject to market conditions, ready access to either the Canadian or United States public capital markets. In addition, we maintain sufficient liquidity through committed credit facilities with a diversified group of banks and institutions which, if necessary, enables us to fund all anticipated requirements for approximately 12 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations, including commitments and guarantees, as they become due. In order to mitigate this risk, we forecast cash requirements over a 91 LIQUIDITY RISK CFaR was $140M or 16% of estimated 12 month forward normalized cash flow. December 31, 2018 The consolidated CFaR policy limit for Enbridge is 35% of its forward 12 month normalized cash flow. At . CFaR assumes that no further mitigating actions are taken to hedge or otherwise minimize exposures and the selection of a 1 month holding period reflects the mix of price risk sensitive assets at Enbridge. As a practical matter, a large portion of Enbridge exposure could be hedged or unwound in a much shorter period if required to mitigate the risks. December 31, 2018 CFaR is a statistically derived measurement used to measure the maximum cash flow loss that could potentially result from adverse market price movements over a 1 month holding period for price sensitive non derivative exposures and for derivative instruments we hold or issue as recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at Effective January 1, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a change in our market risk metric to Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR). The policy change aligns the market risk metric with key result metrics in the organization. We have a Risk Policy to minimize the likelihood that adverse cash flow impacts arising from movements in market prices will exceed a defined risk tolerance. We identify and measure all material market risks including commodity price risks, interest rate risks, foreign exchange risk and equity price risk using a standardized measurement methodology. Our market risk metric consolidates the exposure after accounting for the impact of offsetting risks and limits the consolidated cash flow volatility arising from market related risks to an acceptable approved risk tolerance threshold. Market Risk Management form of stock based compensation, restricted share units. We use a combination of qualifying and non qualifying derivative instruments to manage equity price risk. 1 Equity price risk is the risk of earnings fluctuations due to changes in our share price. We have exposure to our own common share price through the issuance of various forms of stock based compensation, which affect earnings through revaluation of the outstanding units every period. We use equity derivatives to manage the earnings volatility derived from Equity Price Risk Our earnings and cash flows are exposed to changes in commodity prices as a result of our ownership interests in certain assets and investments, as well as through the activities of our energy services subsidiaries. These commodities include natural gas, crude oil, power and NGL. We employ financial and physical derivative instruments to fix a portion of the variable price exposures that arise from physical transactions involving these commodities. We use primarily non qualifying derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk. Commodity Price Risk We primarily use qualifying derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. We also monitor our debt portfolio mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments to manage a consolidated portfolio of floating rate debt within the Board of Directors approved policy limit of a maximum of 30% of floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. . 32% Our earnings and cash flows are also exposed to variability in longer term interest rates ahead of anticipated fixed rate term debt issuances. Forward starting interest rate swaps are used to hedge against the effect of future interest rate movements. We have established a program within some of our subsidiaries to mitigate our exposure to long term interest rate variability on select forecast term debt issuances via execution of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with an average swap rate of 90 . As of December 31, 2018 we do not have any pay floating receive fixed interest rate swaps outstanding . We are exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt that arise as a result of the changes in market interest rates. Pay floating receive fixed interest rate swaps are used, when applicable, to hedge against future changes to the fair value of fixed rate debt which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in the fair value of fixed rate debt via execution of fixed to floating interest rate swaps . 28% Our earnings and cash flows are exposed to short term interest rate variability due to the regular repricing of our variable rate debt, primarily commercial paper. Pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps may be used to hedge against the effect of future interest rate movements. We have implemented a program to significantly mitigate the impact of short term interest rate volatility on interest expense via execution of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with an average swap rate of Interest Rate Risk A combination of qualifying and non qualifying derivative instruments are used to hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses, and to manage variability in cash flows. We hedge certain net investments in United States dollar denominated investments and subsidiaries using foreign currency derivatives and United States dollar denominated debt. We employ financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency denominated earnings exposure. We generate certain revenues, incur expenses, and hold a number of investments and subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings, cash flows and OCI are exposed to fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variability. Foreign Exchange Risk The following summarizes the types of market risks to which we are exposed and the risk management instruments used to mitigate them. We use a combination of qualifying and non qualifying derivative instruments to manage the risks noted below. Our earnings, cash flows and other comprehensive income (OCI) are subject to movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and our share price. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK . Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3 Changes in Accounting Policies Refer to CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES In 2009, the NEB issued a decision related to the LMCI, which required holders of an authorization to operate a pipeline under the NEB Act to file a proposed process and mechanism to set aside funds to pay for future abandonment costs in respect of the sites in Canada used for the operation of a pipeline. The NEB decision stated that while pipeline companies are ultimately responsible for the full costs of abandoning pipelines, abandonment costs are a legitimate cost of providing service and are recoverable from the users of the pipeline upon approval by the NEB. Following the NEB final approval of the collection mechanism and the set aside mechanism for LMCI, we began collecting and setting aside funds to cover future abandonment costs effective January 1, 2015. The funds collected are held in trust in accordance with the NEB decision. The funds collected from shippers are reported within Transportation and other services revenues and Restricted long term investments. Concurrently, we reflect the future abandonment cost as an increase to Operating and administrative expense and Other long term liabilities. data or information that can be derived from past practice, industry practice or the estimated economic life of the asset. 89 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ARO is added to the carrying value of the associated asset and depreciated over the asset useful life. The corresponding liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings and is reduced by actual costs of decommissioning and reclamation. Our estimates of retirement costs could change as a result of changes in cost estimates and regulatory requirements. Currently, for the majority of our assets, there is insufficient data or information to reasonably determine the timing of settlement for estimating the fair value of the ARO. In these cases, the ARO cost is considered indeterminate for accounting purposes, as there is no 9.0% to 17% and 9.0% to 18% ARO associated with the retirement of long lived assets are measured at fair value and recognized as Accounts payable and other or Other long term liabilities in the period in which they can be reasonably determined. The fair value approximates the cost a third party would charge to perform the tasks necessary to retire such assets and is recognized at the present value of expected future cash flows. Discount rates used to estimate the present value the expected future cash flows range from Asset Retirement Obligations . In addition, any unasserted claims that later may become evident could have a material impact on our financial results and certain subsidiaries and investments. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 29. Commitments and Contingencies Provisions for claims filed against us are determined on a case by case basis. Case estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new information is received. The process of evaluating claims involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment. Claims outstanding, the final determination of which could have a material impact on our financial results and certain subsidiaries and investments are detailed in I.

The difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets is amortized over the remaining service period of the active employees. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 26. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits , respectively, as disclosed in I. 2017 and December 31, 2018 for the years ended $174 million and exceeded the expectation by $449 million We maintain pension plans, which provide defined benefit and or defined contribution pension benefits and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) to eligible retirees. Pension costs and obligations for the defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial methods and are funded through contributions determined using the projected benefit method, which incorporates management best estimates of future salary level, other cost escalations, retirement ages of employees and other actuarial factors including discount rates and mortality. We determine discount rates by reference to rates of high quality long term corporate bonds with maturities that approximate the timing of future payments we anticipate making under each of the respective plans. These assumptions are reviewed annually by our actuaries. Actual results that differ from assumptions are amortized over future periods and therefore could materially affect the expense recognized and the recorded obligation in future periods. The actual return on plan assets was below the expectation by 88 Postretirement Benefits When it is determined that the estimated service life of an asset no longer reflects the expected remaining period of benefit, prospective changes are made to the estimated service life. Estimates of useful lives are based on third party engineering studies, experience and or industry practice. There are a number of assumptions inherent in estimating the service lives of our assets including the level of development, exploration, drilling, reserves and production of crude oil and natural gas in the supply areas served by our pipelines as well as the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the integrity of our systems. Changes in these assumptions could result in adjustments to the estimated service lives, which could result in material changes to depreciation expense in future periods in any of our business segments. For certain rate regulated operations, depreciation rates are approved by the regulator and the regulator may require periodic studies or technical updates on useful lives which may change depreciation rates. , respectively, is charged in accordance with 2 primary methods. For distinct assets, depreciation is generally provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets commencing when the asset is placed in service. For largely homogeneous groups of assets with comparable useful lives, the pool method of accounting is followed whereby similar assets are grouped and depreciated as a pool. When group assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains and losses are not reflected in earnings but are booked as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation. $90,711 million and $94,540 million , of 2017 and December 31, 2018 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, our largest asset with a net book value at Depreciation , respectively. 2,366 million and $ 2,252 million , respectively, and significant regulatory liabilities totaled $ 3,477 million and $ 4,073 million , our regulatory assets totaled $ 2017 and December 31, 2018 As at To the extent that the regulator actions differ from our expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or settlement of regulatory balances could differ significantly from those recorded. In the absence of rate regulation, we would generally not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities and the earnings impact would be recorded in the period the expenses are incurred or revenues are earned. A regulatory asset or liability is recognized in respect of deferred income taxes when it is expected the amounts will be recovered or settled through future regulator approved rates. The allowed rate of return is determined in accordance with the applicable regulatory model and may impact our profitability. The rates for a number of our projects are based on a cost of service recovery model that follows the regulators authoritative guidance. Under the cost of service tolling methodology, we calculate tolls based on forecast volumes and cost. A difference between forecast and actual results causes an over or under recovery in any given year. Regulatory assets represent amounts that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods through rates. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods through rates or expected to be paid to cover future abandonment costs in relation to the NEB Land Matters Consultation Initiative (LMCI) and for future removal and site restoration costs as approved by the OEB. Contract and volume throughput assumptions. Allowed rate of return, including the equity comp1nt of the capital structure and related income taxes; and Costs of providing service, including depreciation expense; Certain of our businesses are subject to regulation by various authorities, including but not limited to, the NEB, the FERC, the Alberta Energy Regulator, the NBEUB, La R gie de l energie du Qu bec and the Ontario Energy Board (OEB). Regulatory bodies exercise statutory authority over matters such as construction, rates and ratemaking and agreements with customers. To recognize the economic effects of the actions of the regulator, the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses in these operations may differ from that otherwise expected under Generally accepted accounting principle in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for non rate regulated entities. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are 87 Regulatory Accounting We classify assets as held for sale when management commits to a formal plan to actively market an asset or a group of assets and when management believes it is probable the sale of the assets will occur within 1 year. We measure assets classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying value and their estimated fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence, business climate, legal or regulatory changes, or other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of our assets. We continually monitor our businesses, the market and business environments to identify indicators that could suggest an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, we will assess the fair value of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques. The determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires the use of projections and assumptions regarding future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital. Any changes to these projections and assumptions could result in revisions to the evaluation of the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Asset Impairment of goodwill allocated to assets held for sale. $1,019 million During 2018, we impaired The allocation of goodwill to held for sale and disposed businesses is based on the relative fair value of businesses included in the particular reporting unit. Fair value of our reporting unit is estimated using a combination of discounted cash flow model and earnings multiples techniques. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow model technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, projected operating income, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and working capital levels. The cash flow projections included significant judgments and assumptions relating to revenue growth rates and expected future capital expenditure. The determination of fair value using the earnings multiples technique requires assumptions to be made in relation to maintainable earnings and earnings multipliers for reporting units. We perform our annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the comp1nts of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete information is available, whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those comp1nts and whether the economic and regulatory characteristics are similar. We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our reportable segments, with the exception of the gas transmission and gas midstream reportable segment which is divided at the comp1nt level into 2 reporting units. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair value of our reporting units and comparing those values to the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value. This amount should not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We performed our annual review of the goodwill balance at April 1, which did not result in an impairment charge. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets on acquisition of a business. The carrying value of goodwill, which is not amortized, is assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill Impairment 86 On February 27, 2017, we acquired Spectra Energy for a purchase price of $37.5 billion. In determining the valuation of tangible assets acquired, we applied the cost, market and income approaches. For intangible assets acquired, we used an income approach which included cash flow projections based on historical performance, terms found in contracts and assumptions on expected renewals. Discount rates used in the valuation were also developed using a weighted average cost of capital based on risks specific to respective assets and returns that an investor would likely require given the expected cash flows, timing and risk. Accounting for business combinations requires significant judgment, estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date. In developing estimates of fair values at the acquisition date, we utilize a variety of factors including market data, historical and future expected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The subjective nature of our assumptions increases the risk associated with estimates surrounding the projected performance of the acquired entity. in accounting for our acquisitions. The acquired long lived assets and intangible assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, as well as any contingent consideration, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to 1 year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805 Business Combinations assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In making judgments and estimates, management relies on external information and observable conditions, where possible, supplemented by internal analysis as required. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below have an impact across the various segments of our business. 85 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We and our subsidiaries maintain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. While fully supportable in our view, these tax positions, if challenged by tax authorities, may not be fully sustained on review. TAX MATTERS We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other legal and regulatory actions and proceedings which arise in the normal course of business, including interventions in regulatory proceedings and challenges to regulatory approvals and permits by special interest groups. While the final outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of such actions and proceedings will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. OTHER LITIGATION On October 31, 2018, Bill 4 received Royal Assent from the government of Ontario, providing for the wind down of the Cap and Trade program. This resulted in a reduction of $990 million in Intangible assets and Other long term liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in the fourth quarter of 2018. There was no financial impact to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In accordance with the OEB direction, on September 11, 2018, EGD and Union Gas filed their October 2018 QRAM applications which included the requests to remove Cap and Trade charges from rates, and to refund Cap and Trade related deferral and variance account balances to customers, effective October 1, 2018. The OEB approved EGD's and Union Gas' QRAM applications on September 27, 2018. On July 3, 2018, the government of Ontario issued Ontario Regulation 386 18 which revoked the Cap and Trade program regulation and prohibits registered participants from purchasing, selling, trading or otherwise dealing with emission allowances and credits. Subsequently, on July 6, 2018, the OEB suspended its review of EGD and Union Gas' 2018 Cap and Trade Compliance Plans. On July 25, 2018, the government of Ontario introduced Bill 4 to wind down the Cap and Trade program. Subsequently, by letter dated August 30, 2018, the OEB instructed EGD and Union Gas to request the elimination of Cap and Trade charges as part of their October 2018 Quarterly Rate Adjustment Mechanism (QRAM) application, thereby removing Cap and Trade charges from customer bills effective October 1, 2018. The letter also instructed EGD and Union Gas to request the disposition of any projected aggregate net credit balance in their Cap and Trade related deferral and variance accounts as at September 30, 2018. GAS DISTRIBUTION Sierra Club and 2 other non governmental organizations, as well as the 2 landowners, timely requested rehearing from the FERC of the March 14, 2018 Order. On August 10, 2018, the FERC issued an order denying the requests of Sierra Club and others seeking rehearing of FERC's order on remand. No appeals related to the March 14, 2018 Order were timely filed and the March 14, 2018 Order is now final and non appealable. timely petitions for rehearing. On January 31, 2018, the court denied FERC and Sabal Trail petitions for rehearing. On February 5, 2018, FERC issued its final supplemental environmental impact statement in compliance with the D.C. Circuit decision. In addition, on February 6, 2018, FERC filed a motion with the court requesting a 45 day stay of the mandate. On March 7, 2018, the court granted FERC 45 day request for stay, and directed that issuance of the mandate be withheld through March 26, 2018. On March 14, 2018 FERC issued its Order on Remand Reinstating Certificate and Abandonment Authorizations which addressed the court ruling in the August 22, 2017 decision (March 14, 2018 Order), and on March 30, 2018 the court issued its mandate. 84 Sierra Club and 2 other non governmental organizations filed a Petition for Review of Sabal Trail FERC certificate on September 20, 2016 in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 22, 2017, the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion denying 1 of the petitions, and granting the other petition in part, vacating the certificates, and remanding the case to FERC to supplement the environmental impact statement for the project to estimate the quantity of green house gases to be released into the environment by the gas fired generation plants in Florida that will consume the gas transported by Sabal Trail. The court withheld issuance of the mandate requiring vacatur of the certificate until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. On October 6, 2017, Sabal Trail and FERC each filed Sabal Trail FERC Certificate Review GAS TRANSMISSION AND MIDSTREAM Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline) filed an application for market based rates in December 2011 and refiled in December 2014. Several parties filed comments in opposition alleging that the application should be denied because Seaway Pipeline has market power in both its receipt and destination markets. On December 1, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge issued its decision which concluded that the Commission should grant the application of Seaway Pipeline for authority to charge market based rates. By order dated May 17, 2017, the Commission affirmed the Administrative Law Judge finding that Seaway Pipeline lacks market power in the applicable markets and granted Seaway Pipeline application for market based rate authority. No requests for rehearing or petitions for review were filed. The order is therefore now final. Seaway Pipeline Regulatory Matters On February 4, 2019, the Army Corps produced its administrative record, which includes all documents pertaining to its remand process. The plaintiff Tribes are provided with the opportunity to challenge the completeness of the Army Corps administrative record; briefing on such challenges, should any be filed, will be completed by March 6, 2019. A schedule for filing summary judgment briefs on the merits of the plaintiff Tribes remaining claims will be established following resolution of any administrative record challenges. On June 14, 2017, the Court ruled that the Army Corps did not sufficiently weigh the degree to which the project's effects would be highly controversial and the Army Corps failed to adequately consider the impact of an oil spill on the hunting and fishing rights of the Tribes and on environmental justice (the June 2017 Order). The Court ordered the Army Corps to reconsider those comp1nts of its environmental analysis. On October 11, 2017, the Court issued an order that allows DAPL to continue operating while the Army Corps completes the additional environmental review required by the June 2017 Order. The Court additionally ordered DAPL to implement certain interim measures pending the Army Corps' supplemental analysis. The Army Corps issued its decision on August 31, 2018, and found that no supplemental environmental analysis is required. All four Tribes amended their complaints to include claims challenging the adequacy of the Army Corps supplemental environmental analysis and the Army Corps is required to file the administrative record of its analysis by January 31, 2019. In February 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed motions with the Court contesting the validity of the process used by the Army Corps to permit the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The plaintiffs requested the Court order the operator to shut down the pipeline until the appropriate regulatory process is completed. The Oglala Sioux and Yankton Sioux Tribes also filed claims in the case to challenge the Army Corp permit and environmental review process. Dakota Access Pipeline prejudice Eddyst1 Rail's motion to dismiss the defendants' counterclaims. The defendants chances of success on their counterclaims cannot be predicted at this time. On September 7, 2018, the court granted Eddyst1 motion to amend its complaint to add several affiliates of the corporate defendants as additional defendants. Motions to dismiss Eddyst1 amended complaint were subsequently denied by the court. On January 25, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss Eddyst1 Rail claims from the court based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which motion remains pending. 83 In February 2017, our subsidiary Eddyst1 Rail Company, LLC (Eddyst1 Rail) filed an action against several defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Eddyst1 Rail alleges that the defendants transferred valuable assets from Eddyst1 Rail counterparty in a maritime contract, so as to avoid outstanding obligations to Eddyst1 Rail. Eddyst1 Rail is seeking payment of compensatory and punitive damages in excess of US$140 million. On July 19, 2017, the defendants motions to dismiss Eddyst1 Rail claims were denied. Defendants have filed Answers and Counterclaims, which together with subsequent amendments, seek damages from Eddyst1 Rail in excess of US$32 million. Eddyst1 filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims and defendants amended their Answer and Counterclaims on September 21, 2017. On October 12, 2017 Eddyst1 Rail moved to dismiss the latest version of defendants counterclaims. On February 6, 2018, the court denied without Eddyst1 Rail Legal Matter On January 4, 2017, the Tribal Council of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (the Band) issued a press release indicating that the Band had passed a resolution not to renew its interest in certain Line 5 easements through the Bad River Reservation. Line 5 is included within our mainline system. The Band resolution calls for decommissioning and removal of the pipeline from all Bad River tribal lands and watershed and could impact our ability to operate the pipeline on the Reservation. Since the Band passed the resolution, the parties have agreed to ongoing discussions with the objective of understanding and resolving the Band concerns on a long term basis.

DIVIDENDS Our revenues also include changes in unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity price contracts used to manage exposures from movements in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The mark to market accounting creates volatility and impacts the comparability of revenues in the short term, but we believe over the long term, the economic hedging program supports reliable cash flows and dividend growth. , respectively, were generated primarily through our Energy Services operations. Energy Services includes the contemporaneous purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas, power and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) to generate a margin, which is typically a small fraction of gross revenue. While sales revenue generated from these operations are impacted by commodity prices, net margins and earnings are relatively insensitive to commodity prices and reflect activity levels which are driven by differences in commodity prices between locations, grades and points in time, rather than on absolute prices. Any residual commodity margin risk is closely monitored and managed. Revenues from these operations depend on activity levels, which vary from year to year depending on market conditions and commodity prices. 2016 and 2017 , December 31, 2018 for the years ended $22,816 million and $26,286 million , $27,660 million Commodity sales of , respectively, were recognized in a manner consistent with the underlying rate setting mechanism mandated by the regulator. Revenues generated by the gas distribution businesses are primarily driven by volumes delivered, which vary with weather and customer composition and utilization, as well as regulator approved rates. The cost of natural gas is passed through to customers through rates and does not ultimately impact earnings due to its flow through nature. 2016 and 2017 , December 31, 2018 for the years ended $2,486 million and $4,215 million , $4,360 million Gas distribution sales revenues of accordance with tolls established by the regulator, and in most cost of service based arrangements are reflective of our cost to provide the service plus a regulator approved rate of return. Higher transportation and other services revenues reflected increased throughput on our core liquids pipeline assets combined with the incremental revenues associated with assets placed into service over the past 2 years. 58 , respectively, were earned from our crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation businesses and also include power production revenues from our portfolio of renewable and power generation assets. For our transportation assets operating under market based arrangements, revenues are driven by volumes transported and the corresponding tolls for transportation services. For assets operating under take or pay contracts, revenues reflect the terms of the underlying contract for services or capacity. For rate regulated assets, revenues are charged in 2016 and 2017 , December 31, 2018 for the years ended $9,258 million and $13,877 million , $14,358 million Transportation and other services revenues of We generate revenues from 3 primary sources transportation and other services, gas distribution sales and commodity sales. REVENUES Lower earnings per common share for 2017 is primarily due to the increase in common shares from the issuance of approximately 33 million common shares in December 2017 in a private placement offering, the issuance of approximately 691 million common shares in February 2017 as part of the consideration for the Merger Transaction, the issuance of approximately 75 million common shares in 2016 through the public offering of 56 million common shares in the first quarter of 2016, and ongoing quarterly issuances under our Dividend Reinvestment Program. Additional earnings from the assets acquired in the Merger Transaction were offset by certain unusual, infrequent or other factors, as discussed above. increased earnings from our Gas Transmission and Midstream segment in 2017 due to favorable seasonal firm revenue and a full year of contributions from assets acquired in 2016. contributions from new Liquids Pipelines assets placed into service in 2017; and strong contributions from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to higher throughput primarily attributable to capacity optimization initiatives implemented in 2017 which significantly reduced heavy crude oil apportionment allowing incremental heavy crude oil barrels to be shipped; the absence of earnings from certain assets that were divested since the third quarter of 2016; partially offset by increased earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2017, compared with the corresponding 2016 period. The increase was driven by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in EEP during 2017 as a result of the EEP strategic restructuring actions; and increased interest expense primarily resulting from the settlement of certain pre issuance hedges; increased depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from a significant number of new assets placed into service in 2017; After taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $1,670 million decrease in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders is primarily explained by the following significant business factors the absence in 2017 of cumulative asset impairment charges of $1,561 million ($456 million after tax attributable to us) recorded in 2016 related to EEP's Sandpiper Project, the Northern Gateway Project and Eddyst1 Rail. a non cash, unrealized derivative fair value gain of $1,109 million in 2017 ($624 million after tax attributable to us), compared with a gain of $543 million ($459 million after tax attributable to us) in the corresponding 2016 period reflecting net fair value gains and losses arising from changes in the mark to market value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and commodity prices risks; and ; Income Taxes 25.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note a loss of $4,391 million ($2,753 million after tax attributable to us) and related goodwill impairment of $102 million resulting from the classification of certain assets as held for sale and the subsequent measurement at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, refer to After taking into consideration the contribution of additional earnings from the Merger Transaction, Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders decreased by $151 million due to certain unusual, infrequent or other factors, primarily explained by the following were positively impacted by contributions in the last ten months of 2017 of approximately $2,574 million from assets whose performance was not reflected in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders for 2016 due to the timing of the completion of the Merger Transaction. December 31, 2017 Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2017 Year ended and the issuance of approximately 691 million common shares in February 2017 as part of the consideration for the Merger Transaction. This dilutive effect was partially offset by the increase in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders resulting from the factors discussed above. the issuance of approximately 33 million common shares in December 2017 in a private placement offering, Simplification of Corporate Structure, Lower earnings per common share for 2018 is primarily due to the increase in the number of common shares outstanding following the issuance of approximately 297 million common shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from the buy in of our Sponsored Vehicles, refer to higher income tax expense driven by higher earnings from the business factors described above. higher interest expense primarily due to long term debt issuances in 2017 and the first half of 2018 to finance capital expansions; and increased earnings from our Energy Services segment due to the widening of certain location differentials, which increased opportunities to generate profitable margins; partially offset by increased earnings from our Gas Distribution segment due to colder weather, expansion projects and higher distribution charges resulting from growth in rate base; and increased earnings from some of our Gas Transmission and Midstream equity investments due to favorable margins, favorable commodity prices and increased volume commitments; contributions from new Gas Transmission and Midstream assets placed into service in 2017 and 2018; contributions from new Liquids Pipelines assets placed into service in 2017; stronger contributions from our Liquids Pipelines segment due to a higher foreign exchange hedge rate used to lock in United States dollar denominated Canadian Mainline revenues, a higher IJT Benchmark Toll and higher throughput driven by the full year impact of capacity optimization initiatives implemented in 2017; After taking into consideration the factors above, the remaining $1,222 million increase in Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders is primarily explained by the following significant business factors The non cash, unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses discussed above, generally arise as a result of a comprehensive long term economic hedging program to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. This program creates volatility in reported short term earnings through the recognition of unrealized non cash gains and losses on financial derivative instruments used to hedge these risks. Over the long term, we believe our hedging program supports the reliable cash flows and dividend growth upon which our investor value proposition is based. a gain of $63 million after tax attributable to us in 2018 resulting from the impact of United States Tax Reform on our United States Green Power and Transmission assets. 56 ; and United States Tax Reform a recovery of $223 million after tax attributable to us in 2018 related to rate cases filed that eliminated a portion of the regulated liability formerly included in our US Gas Transmission businesses rate base, refer to the absence in 2018 of transaction costs of $180 million ($131 million after tax attributable to us) recorded in 2017 related to the Merger Transaction; employee severance, transition and transformation costs of $203 million ($181 million after tax attributable to us) in 2018, compared with $354 million ($273 million after tax attributable to us) in the corresponding 2017 period; a deferred income tax recovery of $267 million ($196 million after tax attributable to us) in 2018 related to a change in the assertion for the investment in Canadian renewable energy generation assets due to the pending sale which resulted in a revaluation of the related deferred tax liability to the capital gains tax rate and recognition of previously unrecognized tax basis; Dispositions; Acquisitions and Dispositions 8.

December 31, 2018 We recorded $43 million in tax expense for the year ended During the first quarter of 2018 we refined our calculation of the regulatory liability associated with the TCJA which resulted in a $30 million reduction to the overall regulatory liability. An additional reduction to the regulatory liability in the amount of $223 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with rate cases filed that eliminated a portion of the regulatory liability formerly included in our US Gas Transmission businesses rate base. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA or United States Tax Reform). As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2018, for the year ending December 31, 2017, we recognized reasonable estimates for 1) effects to our deferred tax balances for the impact of the tax rate decrease; and 2) the 1 time impact for the repatriation tax. While our accounting for tax reform pursuant to SAB 118 is complete, the ultimate impact from the TCJA, whether adverse or favorable, is still uncertain. While the United States Treasury has issued substantial guidance in 2018 in the form of proposed regulations, uncertainty will still exist until the regulations are finalized. UNITED STATES TAX REFORM There are many uncertainties with regards to the implementation of the recent FERC actions, including the potential for different outcomes as the result of a rate case or customer challenges. We expect that the elimination of our MLP structures, resulting from the buy in of our Sponsored Vehicles, will allow for all applicable pipelines, 100% owned by us, to qualify for an income tax allowance. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an Order that (1) dismissed all requests for rehearing of its March 15, 2018 revised policy statement and explained that its revised policy statement does not establish a binding rule, but is instead an expression of general policy that the Commission intends to follow in the future; and (2) provides guidance that if an MLP or other tax pass through pipeline eliminates its income tax allowance from its cost of service pursuant to FERC Revised Policy Statement, then Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) will similarly be removed from its cost of service and MLP pipelines may also eliminate previously accumulated sums in ADIT. As a statement of general policy, the FERC will consider alternative application of its tax allowance and ADIT policy on a case by case basis. We hold our United States liquids and natural gas pipelines through a number of different ownership structures. We responded to the FERC announcement regarding tax allowance, both directly and through industry associations, objecting to the change in FERC policy and requesting a re hearing. On April 27, 2018, the FERC issued a tolling order for the purpose of affording it additional time for consideration of matters raised on rehearing. These FERC announcements have adversely affected MLPs generally. a Notice of Inquiry seeking comment on how FERC should address changes related to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation. 53 On March 15, 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) revised a long standing policy announcing that it would no longer permit entities organized as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) to recover an income tax allowance for interstate pipeline assets with cost of service rates. The announcement of the Revised Policy Statement was accompanied by (i) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing interstate natural gas pipelines file a 1 time report to quantify the impact of the federal income tax rate reduction and the impact of the revised Policy Statement on each pipeline; and (ii) REVISED FERC POLICY ON TREATMENT OF INCOME TAXES Growth Projects Regulatory Matters United States Line 3 Replacement Program. On June 28, 2018, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MNPUC) approved the issuance of a Certificate of Need (Certificate) and pipeline route (Route Permit) for construction of the United States Line 3 Replacement Program (U.S. L3R Program) in Minnesota.
